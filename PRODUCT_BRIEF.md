# Product Brief — Charter

## Decision Governance for Modern Teams

The Problem

Teams make important decisions every day — about architecture, policy, ownership, priorities, and risk.

These decisions:

Happen in Slack threads

Are half-documend in wikis

Are implied by pull requests

Are forgotten when people leave


Tools like Jira, GitHub, Confluence, and Slack manage work and content — but none of them answer a simple question:

> Who had the authority to decide this, and what did we actually agree to?

The Solution

Charter is a governance layer that records decisions as first-class objects.

It provides:

Explicit decision-making sessions

Clear scope and authority

Immutable, auditable decision records

Safe evolution of decisions over time


Charter doesn’t replace your tools — it integrates with them.


---

What Makes Charter Different

Existing Tools	Charter

Track tasks	Track legitimacy
Store documents	Preserve agreements
Implicit authority	Explicit authority
Edits overwrite history	Supersession preserves intent
Centralized control	Federated governance


Charter is not about speed — it’s about trust.

How It Works (High Level)

1. A team defines an Area (scope, authority, templates)


2. Decisions are discussed in structured Sessions


3. Accepted decisions become immutable Resolutions


4. Changes happen through supersession, not edits


5. History remains clear and auditable



Optional AI helps facilitate — but humans remain in control.


---

Who It’s For

Product & Engineering teams making architectural decisions

Policy and compliance teams maintaining living policies

Student and research teams collaborating without hierarchy

Founders and small teams building institutional memory

Enterprises needing federated governance without bureaucracy



---

Why Now

Teams are distributed

Decisions are increasingly asynchronous

AI accelerates conversation but not accountability

Governance is falling through the cracks


Charter fills the gap between conversation and commitment.


---

What Charter Does Not Do

Enforce policies

Execute actions

Configure systems

Replace existing workflows


Charter captures agreement, not activity.


---

Vision

Charter becomes the system of record for why things are the way they are — while letting teams choose how they work.


---

Status

Charter is in early development. We are focused on correctness, clarity, and trust before scale.
