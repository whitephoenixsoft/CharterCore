# Charter Core — Product Brief

Modern organizations lose institutional memory through informal decisions, overwritten documents, and unclear authority. Charter Core exists to solve this problem by treating decisions as first-class, auditable artifacts.

Charter Core provides a minimal governance engine that records:
- What was decided
- By whom
- Under what authority
- Within what scope
- And when it changes

Decisions are not overwritten or implied. They are explicitly accepted, versions, reviewed, and retired through structured sessions.

Charter Core is suitable for:
- Software architecture decisions
- Organizational policies
- Governance processes
- Long-lived rules and standards
- Any domain requiring auditability and integrity

Charter Core is not an AI system, chat system, or workflow engine.
It is the foundation upon which such systems can be safely built.
