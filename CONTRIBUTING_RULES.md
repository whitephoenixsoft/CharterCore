# Contributing to Charter — Rules of Integrity

Thank you for your interest in Charter.

Charter is a governance engine.  
Correctness and trust matter more than features.

---

## Core Rule

> **Invariants > MVP convenience > Features**

If a contribution violates a long-term invariant, it will not be accepted,
even if it improves usability or speed.

---

## Before You Contribute

Please read:
- `README.md`
- `PRODUCT_BRIEF.md`
- `INVARIANTS_GOAL.md`
- `MVP_DEVIATIONS.md`

If your change affects decision-making, authority, or scope,
it **must** align with those documents.

---

## What We Welcome

- Documentation improvements
- Clarifying acceptance tests
- Simplifying implementations
- Making invariants more explicit
- Bug fixes that improve integrity

---

## What Requires Discussion First

- New authority models
- Automation or enforcement
- Semantic interpretation of scope
- AI-driven decisions
- Cross-area behavior

---

## What Charter Will Not Become

- A workflow engine
- A task executor
- A configuration manager
- An AI decision-maker

If your idea pushes Charter in these directions,
it likely belongs in an integration, not the core engine.

---

## Final Note

> Charter is intentionally conservative.

That is not a limitation — it is the product.
