# Failure Modes

This document describes known and expected ways in which Charter can fail.

These are not bugs.
They are limits imposed by human systems.

## Known Failure Modes

1. Emotional Resistance

Charter surfaces authority, scope, and accountability.

This can trigger resistance from:

- Individuals who rely on ambiguity
- Informal power structures
- Cultures that avoid explicit commitment

Charter does not mitigate this. It exposes it.

---

2. Ritual Without Meaning

Charter can degrade into performative governance:

- Rubber-stamped resolutions
- Empty authority declarations
- Vague scopes

Charter records legitimacy. It cannot create it.

---

3. Over-Formalization

If Charter is used for every minor decision:

- Velocity drops
- Friction increases
- Users disengage

Healthy usage requires cultural norms.

---

4. Centralization Pressure

Large organizations may attempt to:

- Centralize authority
- Enforce global templates
- Turn Charter into compliance tooling

This undermines federated governance.

---

5. Political Capture

Charter cannot prevent:

- Abuse of authority
- Bad-faith decisions
- Power consolidation

It can only make these visible.

---

## Failure With Integrity

Charter is designed to fail in a specific way:

> When legitimacy is absent, the system should reflect that absence, not obscure it.

Visibility is the last line of defense.
