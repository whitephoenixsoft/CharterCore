# Non-Goals and Explicit Refusals

This document defines what Charter intentionally does not do.

These are permanent design boundaries.

---

## Charter Does Not

### 1. Decide Outcomes

Charter does not:

- Vote
- Optimize decisions
- Choose “best” options

Humans decide. Charter records.

---

### 2. Interpret Meaning

Charter does not:

- Interpret laws
- Resolve legal ambiguity
- Determine correctness

It records what was accepted, not what is true.

---

### 3. Enforce Compliance

Charter does not:

- Enforce behavior
- Police users
- Execute punishment

It is a ledger, not an enforcer.

---

### 4. Replace Deliberation

Charter does not:

- Replace discussion
- Replace debate
- Replace politics

Conversation happens elsewhere.

---

### 5. Claim Neutrality of Outcomes

Charter is neutral about process, not outcomes.

Recording a decision does not imply moral correctness.

---

## AI-Specific Refusals

Even with AI assistance, Charter will not:

- Claim legal correctness
- Assert moral authority
- Override human acceptance

AI may assist comparison, summarization, or recall. Acceptance remains human.
