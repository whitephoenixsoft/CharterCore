# Role Impact and Invisible Work

This document describes how Charter affects existing organizational roles.

Charter does not replace jobs.
It redistributes responsibility for maintaining decision legitimacy and memory.

Much of this responsibility is currently carried informally by individuals whose
primary roles do not explicitly include it.

## The Problem: Invisible Governance Work

In many organizations, critical governance work is performed informally:

- Remembering why decisions were made
- Re-explaining decisions to new stakeholders
- Defending decisions during audits or reviews
- Reconstructing context after personnel changes
- Resolving disputes about who approved what

This work is:

- Essential
- Repetitive
- Emotionally costly
- Rarely recognized as a formal role

Charter exists to make this work structural instead of personal.

---

## Roles Commonly Affected

System Architects and Senior Engineers

These roles often become:

- Living decision logs
- Bottlenecks for institutional memory
- Default arbiters of “why things are this way”

Charter:

- Offloads memory and justification
- Preserves rationale independently of individuals
- Reduces repeated explanation

This does not reduce authority. It reduces cognitive and emotional load.

---

## Scrum Masters and Delivery Facilitators (Partial Impact)

Some responsibilities overlap:

- Enforcing explicit decisions
- Preventing silent agreement
- Preserving shared understanding

Charter replaces:

- Manual decision tracking
- Informal agreement enforcement

Charter does not replace:

- Facilitation
- Coaching
- Conflict resolution
- Cultural stewardship

Strong facilitators benefit from Charter. Weak facilitation may feel threatened by it.

---

## Project Management and PMO Roles

These roles often maintain:

- Project charters
- Decision logs
- Governance documentation

Charter reduces:

- Manual document maintenance
- Copy-paste governance
- Drift between decisions and published artifacts

These roles evolve from document maintenance to governance stewardship.


---

## Compliance, Audit, and Oversight Functions

Charter changes the nature of audit preparation:

From:

- Reconstructing history
- Chasing approvals
- Interpreting intent

To:

- Reviewing explicit decisions
- Verifying authority and scope
- Assessing legitimacy

Charter audits decisions, not behavior.

---

## The Role Charter Most Disrupts (Intentionally)

Charter most strongly impacts informal power structures that rely on ambiguity.

These are not job titles, but behavior patterns:

- Decisions made in side channels
- Authority left implicit
- History rewritten after the fact
- Silence treated as consent

Charter does not confront these behaviors. It makes them visible.

---

## Redistribution, Not Elimination

Charter does not remove responsibility. It redistributes it:

- From individuals → to systems
- From memory → to records
- From personality → to legitimacy

This redistribution improves resilience and fairness.

---

## Design Constraint

Charter must never:

- Claim to replace human judgment
- Claim to automate authority
- Claim to eliminate politics

Its role is to preserve clarity, not to resolve conflict.

---

## Summary

Charter replaces invisible labor, not people.

It turns fragile, informal governance into explicit, shared infrastructure.
