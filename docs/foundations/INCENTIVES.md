# Incentives

This document describes the incentives that make Charter usable, adoptable,
and sustainable in real organizations.

These incentives are not aspirational.
They are observed patterns in human and institutional behavior.

Charter does not attempt to change incentives.
It aligns with existing ones.

## Core Incentives

### 1. Receipts (Defensive Incentive)

Charter produces immutable, authority-checked records of decisions.

These records function as receipts:

- Proof of legitimacy
- Protection against retrospective blame
- Evidence during audits or reviews

This incentive is strongest in:

- Regulated industries
- Large organizations
- Public institutions

---

### 2. Reduced Re-Litigation

Charter prevents implicit re-opening of settled decisions.

Changes require:

- A new session
- Explicit supersession
- Preserved history

This reduces:

- Repeated debates
- Loss of momentum
- Institutional memory decay

---

### 3. Auditability Without Surveillance

Charter audits decisions, not people.

It does not:

- Monitor activity
- Enforce productivity
- Track behavior

This makes auditability compatible with trust.

---

### 4. Legitimacy Signaling

Charter enables organizations to demonstrate:

- Decisions were within scope
- Authority was explicit
- Process was followed

This builds trust even when outcomes are disputed.

---

### 5. Longevity Over Individuals

Charter preserves rationale beyond staff turnover.

Decisions remain explainable even when:

- Authors leave
- Teams reorganize
- Context fades

---

## Non-Incentives (Important)

Charter does not incentivize:

- Speed
- Consensus
- Compliance for its own sake

Its incentives favor clarity and legitimacy over convenience.
