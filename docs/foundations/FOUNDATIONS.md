# Charter Foundations

This directory contains the foundational documents that define the long-term
integrity, boundaries, and intent of the Charter project.

These documents are normative, not descriptive.
They define what Charter is allowed to be.

They are expected to change rarely and deliberately.

---

## Foundational Documents

### INCENTIVES.md

Defines the human and organizational incentives that make Charter usable and sustainable.

This document answers:

- Why people adopt Charter
- Why they continue using it
- Where Charter creates real value

---

### FAILURE_MODES.md

Describes known and expected ways Charter can fail.

This document ensures:

- Failures are honest and visible
- Charter does not overpromise
- Limitations are explicit

---

### NON_GOALS.md

Defines explicit refusals and permanent boundaries.

This document protects Charter from:

- Scope creep
- Misuse
- Ethical overreach

---

### ROLE_IMPACT.md

Explains how Charter redistributes invisible governance work across roles.

This document:

- Acknowledges human cost
- Anticipates resistance
- Frames impact without claiming disruption

---

## Interpretive Priority

In case of ambiguity:

1. NON_GOALS.md overrides all other documents
2. FAILURE_MODES.md clarifies limits
3. INCENTIVES.md explains adoption dynamics
4. ROLE_IMPACT.md explains socio-technical effects

Implementation details must conform to these foundations.

---

## Intent

These documents exist to preserve the integrity of Charter even if:

- The original authors step away
- The code is forked
- The system is reimplemented independently

If an implementation violates these foundations, it is not Charter in spirit, regardless of naming or lineage.
