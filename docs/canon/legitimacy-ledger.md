# Legitimacy Ledger Canon
Version: 1.0  
Status: CANONICAL (Guidance Layer)  
Applies to: Human decision-making systems layered on Charter  
Enforced by: Humans, tools, or guidance engines — **never by Charter Core**

---

## Purpose

The Legitimacy Ledger Canon exists to evaluate **decision ownership**, not decision quality.

It does not optimize outcomes.  
It does not judge correctness.  
It does not create authority.

It provides a **standard against which legitimacy may be examined** — voluntarily and explicitly.

This canon is compatible with:
- personal decision systems
- collaborative governance
- scientific inquiry
- long-lived institutions

It is intentionally demanding.

---

## Definition: Legitimacy

A decision is *legitimate* if it can be defended **after the fact**, using only information that existed **at the moment it was made**, without reinterpretation.

Legitimacy requires:
- explicit authorship
- explicit intent
- explicit ownership
- durable auditability

Being wrong is acceptable.  
Being opaque is not.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Authorship

Every decision must have a clear, explicit author or set of authors.

Implicit ownership invalidates legitimacy.

---

### 2. Legitimacy Over Optimization

A slower legitimate decision is superior to a faster illegitimate one.

Efficiency never overrides accountability.

---

### 3. Explicit Deliberation

Any decision that mutates durable state must explicitly record:
- intent
- rationale
- expected impact

Silence is not deliberation.

---

### 4. Auditability Over Time

Every decision must remain explainable using:
- the information available at the time
- the recorded context
- the declared authority

Retroactive justification is disallowed.

---

### 5. Truth Supremacy

When observed reality contradicts belief, belief must be updated.

No belief is protected from revision by status, seniority, or tradition.

---

### 6. No Hidden State

Undeclared motivations, assumptions, or constraints invalidate legitimacy.

If it matters, it must be stated.

---

### 7. Reversibility Awareness

Every decision must explicitly declare whether it is:
- reversible
- conditionally reversible
- irreversible

Unacknowledged irreversibility is a legitimacy failure.

---

### 8. Authority Is Owned, Not Borrowed

No rule, value, or principle is binding unless it is explicitly adopted.

External authority may be referenced, but never assumed.

---

### 9. Evolution Is Patch-Based

Change occurs only through explicit revision.

Silent drift is disallowed.

Supersession must be visible.

---

### 10. Coherence Is Mandatory

Contradictory commitments must be:
- resolved
- superseded
- or explicitly retired

Unresolved contradiction invalidates legitimacy.

---

## Definition: Commit

A **Commit** is the smallest unit of legitimate change.

A commit is not merely a decision.  
It is a decision the author is willing to be held accountable for in the future.

A commit:
- enters permanent history
- is auditable
- may be superseded, never erased
- represents intentional ownership

---

## Required Commit Attributes

A legitimate commit SHOULD include:

- **Commit ID**  
  A unique identifier.

- **Author(s)**  
  Explicit owners of the decision.

- **Timestamp**  
  When the decision was committed.

- **Decision Statement**  
  A clear, unambiguous description of what is being decided.

- **Rationale**  
  Why this decision is made now.

- **Expected Observable Outcome**  
  What evidence would indicate progress or failure.

- **Reversibility Declaration**  
  Reversible / Conditionally Reversible / Irreversible.

- **Lineage (Optional)**  
  Prior commits this decision builds upon, modifies, or supersedes.

Omission does not invalidate storage —  
but it **weakens legitimacy** under this canon.

---

## Commit Invariants

- Commits are append-only.
- Commits may be superseded, never deleted.
- Legitimacy depends on traceability, not correctness.
- Accountability survives error.

---

## Relationship to Charter

Charter **does not enforce** this canon.

Charter guarantees:
- explicit authority
- explicit acceptance
- immutable audit history
- mechanical legitimacy

This canon operates **above** Charter as:
- a voluntary standard
- a guidance framework
- a basis for AI clarification
- a lens for human reflection

Charter answers:
> “What happened, and was it legitimate?”

This canon asks:
> “Was this decision owned, coherent, and truth-responsive?”

The separation is intentional.

---

## Usage Modes

This canon may be applied:
- personally (decision journaling)
- collaboratively (governance hygiene)
- scientifically (hypothesis tracking)
- institutionally (long-lived rule systems)

Adoption is explicit.
Enforcement is human.
Guidance may be automated.
Authority is never inferred.

---

## Closing Principle

This system does not aim to produce perfect decisions.

It exists to produce decisions that are:
- owned
- coherent
- auditable
- revisable in the presence of truth

Legitimacy is not comfort.
Legitimacy is responsibility.
