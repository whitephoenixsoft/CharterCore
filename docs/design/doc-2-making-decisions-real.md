# Making Decisions Real  
*A practical mental model for decisions that don’t quietly fall apart*

## This Is Still Not a Tool

If the previous document made you nod, this one gives names to what you were already feeling.

No commands.
No software.
No bureaucracy.

Just a clearer mental model you can use immediately — alone or with others.

## The Core Insight

Most problems blamed on “communication” are actually problems of **decision shape**.

A decision that has no clear shape:
- leaks legitimacy
- invites reinterpretation
- decays into opinion
- creates emotional friction later

So let’s give decisions a shape.

---

## What a Decision Actually Is (and Is Not)

A decision is **not**:
- a discussion
- a document
- a preference
- a consensus vibe
- a plan

A decision *is*:
> **An explicit choice that becomes legitimate at a specific moment, under known conditions.**

That’s it.

Everything else is support material.

## Four Things Every Durable Decision Needs

You don’t need process.  
You need **clarity on four dimensions**.

### 1. A Moment — *When did this become real?*

If you can’t point to *when* a decision was accepted, it’s not stable.

Examples:
- “We talked about it” ❌
- “We agreed sometime last sprint” ❌
- “On Tuesday, we accepted option B” ✅

Without a moment:
- nothing can be superseded
- nothing can be corrected cleanly
- everything stays debatable forever

---

### 2. A Boundary — *Where does this apply?*

Decisions always live **somewhere**:
- this family
- this team
- this project
- this phase of life

Problems arise when boundaries are implicit.

Example failure:
> “I thought that only applied to that project.”

Clear boundaries prevent:
- accidental overreach
- silent exceptions
- endless “does this apply here?” debates

---

### 3. A Rule — *How was agreement evaluated?*

Not every decision needs consensus.
Not every decision needs hierarchy.

But **every decision needs a known rule**:
- unanimous
- majority
- single owner
- advisory input

If the rule isn’t explicit, people reverse-engineer legitimacy later — usually emotionally.

---

### 4. A Way to Change It — *How does this stop being true?*

This is the most overlooked part.

Decisions don’t die naturally.
They only:
- get replaced
- get explicitly retired
- or rot in place

If changing a decision feels like:
- betrayal
- failure
- drama

Then the system is punishing honesty.

A healthy model makes change **explicit, not awkward**.

---

## Why “Just Write It Down” Isn’t Enough

Documentation helps — but documents lie politely.

They:
- don’t tell you *which version mattered*
- don’t tell you *who accepted it*
- don’t tell you *what replaced it*

That’s why teams have:
- policies everyone ignores
- docs no one trusts
- decisions that exist only as arguments

The problem isn’t writing.
It’s **legitimacy without structure**.

---

## This Applies Everywhere (Again)

### Self
You can say:
> “I decided this — and later I changed it.”

No guilt.
No rewriting history.
Just two explicit moments.

---

### Friends & Family
You can say:
> “We decided this before. Are we changing it, or still honoring it?”

That question only works if decisions are real things.

---

### Work
You can say:
> “This was accepted under these conditions. If they’ve changed, we need a new decision.”

That removes blame instantly.

---

## What This Model Deliberately Avoids

This way of thinking does **not**:
- judge correctness
- optimize outcomes
- enforce compliance
- eliminate disagreement

It only does one thing:

> **It separates deciding from drifting.**

That alone removes an enormous amount of friction.

---

## Why This Matters Before Tools, Specs, or Software

If you skip this mental model and jump straight to tools:
- everything feels heavy
- people resist
- structure feels punitive

If you start here:
- tools feel relieving
- explicitness feels kind
- change feels safe

Software can come later.
Process can come later.

Clarity comes first.

---

## What Comes Next

The next step is not:
> “Apply this everywhere.”

It’s:
> “Choose one place where decisions currently dissolve — and try making just one decision explicit.”

From there:
- specifications make sense
- governance feels lighter
- audits stop being scary
- change stops being shameful

This is the mental foundation the rest builds on.
