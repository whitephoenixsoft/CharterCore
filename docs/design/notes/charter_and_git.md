# Charter And Git

It might be a good idea to create a CLI like git. This would follow the solo developer simulations.

It can also be used to export into files and sourced controlled in git. This will document application team and business rules offline.

I think I could use this application already to document all my design decisions and collaboration roles if people help.

## Notes

- Git = transport + review
- Charter = legitimacy + invariants
- Git does not know authority
- Charter does not know merge
- Import ≠ accept, meaning new imports must be explicitly agreed go locally before being used (next point)
- Confirmation sessions preserve local legitimacy
