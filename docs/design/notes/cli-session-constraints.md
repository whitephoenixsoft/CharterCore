Session constraints are not modeling group dynamics
They are modeling explicit legitimacy conditions.
This is a critical distinction.
A constraint like:
“Alice must ACCEPT”
does not mean:
Alice is the boss
Alice can override the group
Alice always decides
It means:
“This decision is illegitimate unless Alice explicitly agrees.”
That’s a recording choice, not a power theory.
So your earlier instinct was correct:
Session constraints do not solve group dynamics
They only encode declared legitimacy conditions
That’s as far as Charter should go.
Two clean patterns emerge
Pattern A — “Boss decides”
Declare authority as SOLO (or equivalent) Record others as participants for context only
This is honest and auditable.
Pattern B — “Majority, but boss must agree”
Declare:
Authority: MAJORITY_PRESENT
Required approver: Boss
This does not say the boss is superior. It says:
“This group considers the decision invalid without this person.”
That’s all.
If an org wants:
escalation paths
override mechanics
fallback authority
Those become new sessions with new authority declarations.
No shortcuts.
