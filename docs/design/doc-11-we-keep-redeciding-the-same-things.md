# We Keep Re-Deciding the Same Things — And No One Knows Why

If your team has ever said:

- “Didn’t we already decide this?”
- “I swear we talked about this last year.”
- “Why are we reopening this *again*?”

You’re not alone.

This isn’t forgetfulness.
It’s something deeper — and very common.

## Decisions Decay When They Aren’t Remembered

Decisions don’t stay decided just because they happened once.

They decay.

They fade when:
- they aren’t written down,
- the people involved leave,
- the context changes,
- or no one remembers *why* the decision was made.

Eventually, a decision without memory looks exactly like:
> “An opinion someone once had.”

And opinions are always up for debate.

## Re-Litigation Is a Symptom, Not Dysfunction

Teams often treat repeated debates as a failure:

- “We’re spinning our wheels.”
- “We can’t commit.”
- “We overthink everything.”

But re-deciding the same things is rarely about indecision.

It’s usually about **lost history**.

When the reasoning disappears, reopening the decision is rational.
People aren’t being difficult.
They’re missing information.

## Turnover Makes Amnesia Inevitable

In long-running teams or project-based work:
- people join after decisions were made,
- people leave before consequences show up,
- and knowledge becomes tribal.

New members ask good questions.
Old members vaguely remember answers.
No one can point to *the decision* itself.

So the debate starts again — from scratch.

## History Is Part of Decision Quality

A decision isn’t just:
- *what* was chosen,

but also:
- *when* it was chosen,
- *under what constraints*,
- and *what alternatives were rejected*.

Without that history:
- old decisions feel arbitrary,
- new challenges feel personal,
- and progress feels fragile.

With history:
- disagreement becomes informed,
- change becomes deliberate,
- and improvement doesn’t require erasure.

## The Quiet Cost of Forgetting

When teams constantly re-decide:
- trust erodes (“Why bother deciding?”),
- confidence drops (“Nothing sticks here”),
- and energy drains (“We’ve done this before”).

People stop investing emotionally.
Not because they don’t care —
but because the system doesn’t remember.

## What This Sets Up

This document isn’t proposing a tool.
It isn’t introducing a process.
It isn’t naming a solution.

It’s pointing at a missing layer:

**Decisions need memory.  
Not to prevent change — but to make change meaningful.**

Once you see that,
the existence of something like Charter
stops feeling theoretical
and starts feeling inevitable.
