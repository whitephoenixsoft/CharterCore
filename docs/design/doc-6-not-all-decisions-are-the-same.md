# Not All Decisions Are the Same  
## (And Treating Them Like They Are Is Why Everyone Is Tired)

Most frustration around decision-making comes from a simple mistake:

**We treat all decisions as if they belong to the same category.**

They don’t.

When we mix different kinds of decisions together:
- meetings drag on
- authority gets blurry
- responsibility leaks
- people feel stupid, defensive, or checked out
- the loudest or longest-tenured person “wins” by default

This isn’t a people problem.  
It’s a *categorization* problem.

Let’s fix that.

## The Core Idea (Simple, but Dangerous)

Before asking **“what should we decide?”**, you need to ask:

> **“What *kind* of decision is this?”**

Different kinds of decisions require:
- different levels of agreement
- different people involved
- different time horizons
- different emotional weight

If you don’t separate them, everything feels personal — even when it shouldn’t.

---

## The Four Common Decision Layers

These layers exist whether you name them or not.

Naming them just makes the chaos visible.

---

## 1. Personal Decisions  
**“This affects me.”**

These decisions:
- belong to one person
- do not require consensus
- may benefit from advice, but not permission

### Examples
- **Self**: “Should I change jobs?”
- **Family**: “I need quiet time tonight.”
- **Work**: “I’m choosing this implementation approach.”

### What goes wrong when this layer is violated
- People ask for permission they don’t need
- Others feel entitled to weigh in
- Guilt replaces clarity

> *If you need a committee to decide your lunch, something is off.*

---

## 2. Shared Decisions  
**“This affects us directly.”**

These decisions:
- impact a defined group
- require explicit agreement rules
- fail if participation is vague

### Examples
- **Friends**: “Where are we going for dinner?”
- **Family**: “Are we moving?”
- **Work**: “Which architecture do we commit to?”

### What goes wrong here
- “Everyone agrees” is assumed, not checked
- Silence is mistaken for approval
- Later resentment appears out of nowhere

> *The fight isn’t about the decision. It’s about who thought they were included.*

---

## 3. Governance Decisions  
**“This defines how future decisions will be made.”**

These are the most dangerous to mix with others.

They define:
- who gets to decide
- how agreement works
- what happens when people disagree

### Examples
- **Friends**: “One person picks movies this month.”
- **Family**: “Emergencies override normal rules.”
- **Work**: “Majority vote for roadmap decisions.”

### What goes wrong
- Governance is implicit instead of explicit
- Rules change mid-argument
- Power struggles replace problem-solving

> *If you argue about fairness during a decision, you’re actually arguing about governance.*

---

## 4. Historical Decisions  
**“This already happened.”**

These decisions:
- are done
- should not be re-litigated
- exist to inform, not control

### Examples
- **Self**: “I chose this path.”
- **Family**: “We already agreed to this.”
- **Work**: “This was decided last quarter.”

### What goes wrong
- Old decisions are quietly reopened
- People rewrite history to justify feelings
- Accountability dissolves

> *You can learn from the past without putting it back on trial.*

## Why Everything Breaks When Layers Collapse

Here’s the real problem:

We often try to resolve **governance** disagreements  
using **shared decision** techniques  
while people are emotionally reacting at a **personal** level  
about something that is already **historical**.

That’s how you get:
- endless meetings
- passive-aggressive Slack threads
- “alignment” that evaporates a week later

Everyone leaves exhausted — and nothing feels legitimate.

---

## Same Problem, Different Layers (Concrete Example)

**Problem**: “We should deploy faster.”

- **Personal**: “I don’t feel safe owning deploys.”
- **Shared**: “Do we agree to weekly releases?”
- **Governance**: “Who can approve a deploy?”
- **Historical**: “We decided this six months ago.”

If you argue only at the *shared* layer, you miss the real tension.
If you jump straight to governance, people feel bulldozed.
If you reopen history, trust erodes.

Correct layer → calm discussion.  
Wrong layer → emotional chaos.

---

## Why This Keeps You Sane

Once you start asking *which layer* you’re in:

- disagreements feel less personal
- authority stops being awkward
- you stop over-explaining yourself
- you stop re-deciding the same thing forever

Most importantly:

> **You can disagree without shame.**

Because disagreement doesn’t mean failure —  
it often just means you’re in different layers.

---

## One Final Thought

You don’t need software to do this.
You don’t need formal processes.
You don’t even need agreement.

You just need the courage to pause and ask:

> **“What kind of decision are we actually making right now?”**

Everything else becomes easier once that question is answered.
