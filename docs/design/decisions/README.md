# Project Design Decisions

This folder captures **project-wide decisions** that are:

- not engine specs
- not invariants
- not code
- but still must persist

These decisions shape:
- contributor expectations
- future integrations
- what Charter will never become

## Examples

- “Charter will not become a workflow engine”
- “Legitimacy must always be explicit”
- “Server mode compatibility must be preserved”

## Why This Exists

Without this folder:
- decisions turn into vibes
- newcomers repeat old debates
- direction slowly drifts

This is the project’s long-term memory for intent.

If a decision:
- constrains future work
- keeps resurfacing
- feels obvious only after discussion

Write it down.
