# How Siloed Teams Converge  
## Without Constant Meetings (or Losing Their Minds)

Most organizations don’t have a *decision-making problem*.

They have a **convergence problem**.

Teams are doing work.
Decisions are being made.
Things are moving.

And yet:
- dependencies collide late
- teams feel “blocked” by people they never talked to
- alignment meetings multiply
- nobody is quite sure *who* decided *what*

This isn’t because teams are bad.
It’s because **convergence is invisible** until it hurts.

---

## The Core Problem (No One Names It)

In most organizations:
- teams decide *locally*
- consequences appear *globally*
- convergence is expected to “just happen”

It doesn’t.

What actually happens is:
- teams move fast in isolation
- conflicts surface only at integration time
- urgency replaces clarity
- meetings become retroactive justification sessions

Everyone feels busy.  
No one feels aligned.

---

## What Convergence Actually Means

Convergence is **not** agreement.
It’s not consensus.
It’s not everyone being in the same meeting.

Convergence means:
> **Independent decisions eventually land in a coherent reality.**

That’s it.

You don’t need constant coordination.
You need **predictable points where reality snaps back together**.

---

## Why Meetings Are the Wrong Default Tool

Meetings are often used to:
- synchronize understanding
- negotiate authority
- surface conflicts
- retroactively legitimize decisions

That’s a lot to ask from a calendar invite.

Meetings fail because:
- they mix decision layers
- they blur authority
- they reward confidence over clarity
- they scale poorly

> *If convergence requires everyone’s presence, the system doesn’t scale.*

## The Hidden Structure of Siloed Teams

Whether acknowledged or not, most organizations already operate like this:

- **Local Autonomy**  
  Teams make decisions quickly inside their domain.

- **Delayed Visibility**  
  Other teams learn about those decisions later.

- **Late Collision**  
  Conflicts surface only when work intersects.

- **Emergency Alignment**  
  Meetings appear. Stress spikes. Blame lurks.

This is normal — not a failure.

The mistake is pretending it won’t happen.

---

## The Shift: From Coordination to Declaration

High-functioning organizations don’t coordinate everything.

They **declare decisions early and visibly**, even when:
- they might change later
- they’re incomplete
- they only affect one team *for now*

The goal is not permission.
The goal is **early awareness**.

> *You can’t react to a decision you don’t know exists.*

---

## Convergence Happens in Layers (Again)

Let’s reuse the decision layers — now at team scale.

### 1. Local Team Decisions  
**“This only affects us.”**

- internal refactors
- tooling choices
- sprint execution details

These should move fast and quietly.

No convergence needed — *until they escape the boundary.*

---

### 2. Interface Decisions  
**“This touches others.”**

- APIs
- data contracts
- shared infrastructure
- timelines that affect dependencies

These don’t require approval —  
they require **visibility**.

Most pain comes from discovering these too late.

---

### 3. Governance Decisions  
**“This defines how teams interact.”**

- ownership boundaries
- escalation paths
- integration rules
- release authority

These decisions should be:
- rare
- explicit
- slow enough to be understood

> *If teams argue repeatedly, governance is missing — not effort.*

---

### 4. Historical Decisions  
**“This already shaped the system.”**

- legacy constraints
- prior trade-offs
- past failures and successes

Ignoring history causes repeat pain.
Re-litigating history causes paralysis.

The goal is **acknowledgment**, not guilt.

---

## How Teams Converge Without Meetings

Here’s the practical pattern that works:

### 1. Decide Locally  
Teams decide within their boundary without waiting.

### 2. Declare Early  
Decisions are written down and visible:
- what was decided
- who decided it
- what it affects
- when it might change

### 3. Invite Reaction, Not Approval  
Others can:
- flag conflicts
- ask questions
- request reconsideration

But silence is not agreement — and agreement isn’t required.

### 4. Re-converge Only When Necessary  
Meetings happen when:
- boundaries are crossed
- governance is unclear
- reality diverges too far

Not by default.

## Why This Feels Uncomfortable at First

Because it removes familiar hiding places.

- No more “I didn’t know”
- No more “we never agreed”
- No more authority by surprise

Clarity can feel confrontational — until trust forms.

Then it feels relieving.

---

## A Familiar Anti-Pattern (With Humor)

> “Why wasn’t I consulted?”

Translation:
- “I discovered this too late.”
- “I thought I had veto power.”
- “I’m reacting emotionally, not structurally.”

The fix is not more meetings.
It’s **earlier declarations** and **clearer authority boundaries**.

---

## What This Gives Organizations

When convergence is intentional:
- silos stay fast
- conflicts surface early
- integration is calmer
- accountability is visible
- fewer meetings actually work

Most importantly:
> **People stop confusing surprise with disrespect.**

---

## Final Thought

You don’t eliminate silos.
You don’t force alignment.
You don’t scale consensus.

You create a system where:
- decisions are visible
- authority is explicit
- convergence is inevitable — not accidental

Everything else is noise.
