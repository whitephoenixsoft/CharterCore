# When Decisions Don’t Really Exist  
*A practical introduction to deliberate decision-making*

---

## A familiar story (you don’t need to work in tech)

A family is deciding where to eat.

Everyone throws out ideas.  
No one agrees.  
Someone says, “Whatever.”  
Someone else says, “Fine, let’s just go.”  

An hour later, everyone is annoyed — and still hungry.

No one made a decision.  
Something just *happened*.

That’s not a failure of people.  
That’s a failure of structure.

---

## This happens everywhere (just with better vocabulary)

At work, it sounds more professional:

- “Let’s circle back”
- “We’ll iterate”
- “We’ll see how it goes”
- “That sounds reasonable”

But the result is the same:
- no clear owner
- no clear agreement
- no clear moment where the decision became real

So what fills the gap?

- the loudest person  
- the longest-tenured person  
- the last person who didn’t quit  
- or the person who *can’t say no*

Congratulations — you now have **accidental authority**.

## The hidden cost nobody talks about

When decisions aren’t explicit:

- Developers build things that quietly change later
- Analysts write specs that “made sense at the time”
- Managers rotate out and take context with them
- New people inherit outcomes without understanding why

Months later, someone asks:

> “Why did we do it this way?”

And the honest answer is:

> “Because nobody stopped us.”

That’s not governance.  
That’s momentum.

## Self-managing teams struggle for the same reason

Self-management doesn’t fail because people are irresponsible.

It fails because:
- no one is taught **how a decision becomes legitimate**
- authority is assumed instead of declared
- disagreement is avoided instead of resolved

So teams fall back on:
- seniority
- confidence
- exhaustion
- or silence

The loudest voice wins — not because it’s right, but because it’s *still talking*.

---

## This isn’t about control. It’s about relief.

Here’s the uncomfortable truth:

Most people don’t actually want power.  
They want **clarity**.

They want to know:
- Who is allowed to decide?
- Who needs to agree?
- When is the decision final?
- What happens if we change our mind later?

Without answers to those questions:
- people hesitate
- people overstep
- people burn out
- people get blamed for decisions they never officially made

## What a “real” decision actually is

A real decision has three properties:

1. **It’s explicit**  
   Someone can point to the moment it happened.

2. **It has legitimacy**  
   The right people were involved *on purpose*, not by accident.

3. **It has memory**  
   Even if it changes later, you can see what existed before.

Without those, you don’t have decisions.  
You have **stories people tell after the fact**.

---

## This applies to life, not just work

- Family rules that “everyone agreed on”
- Friend group plans that somehow always benefit the same person
- Personal goals you “decided” but never committed to

If you’ve ever said:

> “I guess that’s just how it is now”

You’ve experienced an undecided decision.

## The point of this guide (and the ones that follow)

This isn’t about:
- bureaucracy
- paperwork
- process for process’ sake

It’s about learning a simple idea:

> Decisions deserve the same care as actions.

When decisions are deliberate:
- conflict becomes safer
- disagreement becomes useful
- change becomes explainable
- and nobody has to carry invisible responsibility alone

---

## One last thing (important)

If any part of this felt uncomfortably familiar —  
that’s not because you failed.

It’s because **almost nobody is taught how to decide together**.

The rest of these documents exist to change that —  
slowly, practically, and without shame.
