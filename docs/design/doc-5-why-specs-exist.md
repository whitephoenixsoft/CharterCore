# Why Specs Exist (Even If You Hate Writing Them)

*A guide for developers, analysts, and anyone stuck translating ideas into reality*

---

## The quiet resentment loop

Developers think:
> “The requirements are vague.”

Analysts think:
> “The developers are being difficult.”

Managers think:
> “Why is this taking so long?”

Everyone is right — and everyone is missing the same thing.

## Most specs are trying to do the wrong job

A spec is usually treated like:
- a contract
- a checklist
- or a technical prophecy

So it turns into:
- pseudo-code in English  
- business buzzwords stapled together  
- or a document everyone agrees to ignore later  

Then, months down the line, someone says:

> “That’s not what the spec said.”

And someone else replies:

> “That’s not what we meant.”

## What specs were always meant to be

A spec isn’t there to predict the future.

It exists to answer three questions **at a specific moment in time**:

1. What problem are we trying to solve *right now*?
2. Who is allowed to decide what “done” means?
3. What did we agree on — explicitly — before we started building?

If a document doesn’t answer those, it’s not a spec.  
It’s a hope.

## Analysts live in the middle (and it’s uncomfortable)

Analysts are often told:
- “Be technical”
- “But not too technical”
- “Capture the business intent”
- “But don’t slow things down”

So they guess.

They guess what developers need.  
They guess what the business will accept.  
They guess who actually has authority.

And guessing feels like competence — until it breaks.

---

## Developers aren’t allergic to documentation

They’re allergic to:
- documents that pretend certainty
- specs that rewrite history later
- requirements that shift without acknowledgment

Developers don’t hate writing things down.  
They hate being blamed by documents.

---

## The missing layer: explicit decisions

Most specs fail because they skip the hardest part:

> **Who decided this — and under what authority?**

Without that:
- acceptance criteria feel arbitrary
- business rules feel negotiable
- changes feel personal

With it:
- disagreement becomes normal
- change becomes traceable
- rewrites become honest instead of defensive

---

## A spec doesn’t need to be perfect. It needs to be honest.

Good specs say:
- “This is what we decided”
- “This is who agreed”
- “This can change — but not silently”

Bad specs pretend:
- nothing will change
- everyone agreed
- disagreement never existed

Reality always wins eventually.

---

## If you remember one thing

Specs aren’t about control.  
They’re about **protecting people from ambiguity**.

When decisions are explicit:
- analysts stop guessing
- developers stop mind-reading
- teams stop fighting ghosts

The work doesn’t magically get easier —  
but it gets *cleaner*.

And clean work ages better than clever work.
