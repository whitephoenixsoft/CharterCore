# Sessions, Decisions, and Legitimacy  
## How Charter Moves From Thought to Commitment

This document explains **how Charter turns recorded human activity into legitimate decisions**.

It complements:
- *Audit, Breakouts, and Synthesis* (exploration → convergence)

This document covers:
- sessions
- authority
- proposals and candidates
- acceptance
- closure
- legitimacy preservation

Together, these documents describe the full governance lifecycle —
from thinking, to preparation, to commitment.

## The Core Distinction

Charter separates three things humans routinely collapse:

1. **Exploring and doing work**
2. **Reaching agreement**
3. **Recording legitimacy**

Only the third creates authority.

Everything else exists to support it —  
and must never be mistaken for it.

---

## Sessions: The Only Place Legitimacy Is Created

A **session** is the smallest and only unit of legitimacy in Charter.

A session:
- declares an authority
- declares constraints
- records explicit participants
- evaluates explicit candidates 
- records explicit stances
- terminates explicitly

Nothing outside a session creates legitimacy.

Not breakouts.  
Not synthesis.  
Not baseline reviews.  
Not imports.  

Sessions do not *discover* decisions.  
They *record* them.

---

## Proposals and Candidates: What Sessions Evaluate

A **proposal** is a concrete claim presented for legitimacy.

Proposals may originate from:
- synthesis outputs
- baseline reviews
- deliberate authoring
- imported material (after review)

A proposal:
- has identity
- has content
- has provenance
- carries **no authority** until accepted

Within a session, proposals are evaluated as **candidates**.

Candidates:
- imply no intent
- imply no endorsement
- acquire meaning only if accepted

Sessions do not invent content.
They judge whether content becomes legitimate.

---

## Authority: How Agreement Is Measured

Authority defines **how legitimacy is computed**, not what is correct.

Authority specifies:
- who has standing
- how stances are evaluated
- what counts as acceptance

Authority is:
- explicit
- immutable for the lifetime of a session
- evaluated mechanically

Authority never:
- infers intent
- interprets silence
- assigns meaning to content
- resolves ambiguity

Authority measures agreement — nothing more.

---

## Stances: Explicit, Final, Auditable

Participants record stances explicitly:
- ACCEPT
- REJECT
- ABSTAIN
- (extensions may exist, but must be explicit)

Stances:
- are first-class audit events
- never expire
- are never reinterpreted
- freeze candidate sets once recorded

Silence is not a stance.  
Absence is not a stance.  
Metadata is not a stance.

If it was not recorded, it did not happen.

---

## Acceptance: Recording Legitimacy

Acceptance is a **deliberate act**, not an outcome inference.

Acceptance:
- occurs explicitly
- occurs once per session
- is auditable
- seals legitimacy permanently

Acceptance does not:
- erase disagreement
- imply correctness
- imply permanence
- suppress alternatives

Acceptance records *that legitimacy occurred* —
not that everyone agreed.

---

## Closure: Ending the Legitimacy Moment

When a session closes:
- its authority context is sealed
- its participant set is frozen
- its outcomes become immutable

Closed sessions:
- are exportable
- are auditable
- are referenceable
- persist indefinitely

Sessions never reopen.
New legitimacy always requires a new session.

---

## Restart-From: Preserving Context Without Carrying Authority

Restart-from exists to preserve **memory**, not legitimacy.

Restarting:
- closes the prior session
- creates a new session
- carries no stances
- carries no acceptance
- records lineage only

This reflects human reality:

> “We discussed this before —  
> but this is a new decision.”

Nothing is erased.
Authority is not inherited.
History remains visible.

---

## Baseline Review: Legitimacy at Scale

Baseline review is a **consolidation boundary**, not a decision system.

It exists to:
- gather proposals
- preserve provenance
- structure review
- prepare sessions safely

Baseline review:
- never evaluates authority
- never votes
- never creates legitimacy directly

Every accepted outcome still corresponds to a session —
explicitly or mechanically.

Baseline review orchestrates legitimacy.
It does not replace it.

---

## Importing and Foreign Material

Imported material is always treated as:
- foreign
- non-authoritative
- historically contextual

Import creates:
- review context
- preserved provenance
- auditable lineage

Local authority always governs acceptance.
Trust is never assumed.
Similarity never implies legitimacy.

---

## The Full Lifecycle (Top to Bottom)

1. **Exploration**
   - Breakouts
   - Notes
   - Options
   - Questions

2. **Convergence**
   - Synthesis
   - Structured proposals
   - Discarded paths
   - Open issues

3. **Evaluation**
   - Sessions
   - Authority
   - Explicit stances

4. **Legitimacy**
   - Acceptance
   - Closure
   - Immutable outcomes

5. **Memory**
   - Audit
   - Export
   - Import
   - Baseline review
   - Historical continuity

At no point does Charter:
- guess intent
- infer agreement
- reinterpret silence
- erase disagreement
- shortcut legitimacy

---

## Why This Matters

Most systems collapse:
- discussion into decision
- silence into consent
- outcomes into history

Charter refuses to.

It preserves:
- uncertainty
- disagreement
- abandoned paths
- failed attempts
- context

Legitimacy becomes something you can **demonstrate**, not assert.

---

## Final Principle

Charter does not optimize for speed.
It optimizes for **defensibility**.

If a decision mattered:
- you can show how it was evaluated
- under what authority
- by whom
- against what alternatives
- at what moment

And if you cannot —
Charter will not pretend that you did.
