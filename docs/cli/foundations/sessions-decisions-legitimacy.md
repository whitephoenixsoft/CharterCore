# Sessions, Decisions, and Legitimacy  
## How Charter Moves From Thought to Commitment

This document explains **how Charter turns human activity into legitimate decisions**.

It complements:
- *Audit, Breakouts, and Synthesis* (exploration → convergence)

This document covers:
- sessions
- authority
- proposals
- acceptance
- closure

Together, these documents describe the full governance lifecycle from start to finish.

## The Core Distinction

Charter separates three things that humans often blur:

1. **Doing work**
2. **Reaching agreement**
3. **Recording legitimacy**

Only the third creates authority.

Everything else prepares for it.

---

## Sessions: The Only Place Legitimacy Is Created

A **session** is the smallest unit of legitimacy in Charter.

A session:
- has a defined authority
- has explicit participants
- evaluates explicit proposals
- records explicit stances
- ends in acceptance or non-acceptance

Nothing outside a session creates legitimacy.

Not breakouts.  
Not synthesis.  
Not baselines.  
Not imports.  

---

## Proposals: What Sessions Evaluate

A proposal is a **candidate resolution** presented to a session.

Proposals may originate from:
- synthesis outputs
- baseline reviews
- direct authoring
- imports (after review)

A proposal:
- has identity
- has content
- has provenance
- has no authority until accepted

Sessions do not invent proposals — they judge them.

---

## Authority: How Agreement Is Measured

Authority defines:
- who must participate
- how stances are evaluated
- what counts as acceptance

Authority is:
- explicit
- immutable for a session
- evaluated mechanically

Authority does not infer intent.
Authority does not guess consensus.
Authority only computes outcomes from recorded stances.

---

## Stances: Recorded, Not Interpreted

Participants express stances explicitly:
- ACCEPT
- REJECT
- ABSTAIN
- (future extensions possible)

Stances:
- are first-class audit events
- never expire
- are never reinterpreted

Silence is not a stance.
Absence is not a stance.

---

## Acceptance: A Deliberate Act

Acceptance:
- occurs once per session
- is explicit
- is auditable
- freezes the outcome

Acceptance does not erase disagreement.
Acceptance records legitimacy.

A rejected or blocked session is still valuable history.

---

## Closure: Ending the Moment

When a session closes:
- its authority context is sealed
- its participants are frozen
- its outcome becomes immutable

Closed sessions are:
- exportable
- auditable
- referenceable
- permanent

Nothing reopens a session.
New decisions require new sessions.

---

## Restarting: Preserving History Without Carrying Authority

Restart-from exists to:
- preserve context
- discard legitimacy
- continue work safely

Restarting:
- closes the prior session
- creates a new session
- carries no votes
- carries no acceptance
- records lineage only

This mirrors human reality:
> “We talked about this before — but we’re deciding again.”

---

## Baseline Review: Legitimacy at Scale

Baseline review exists to:
- evaluate many proposals together
- preserve deliberation history
- batch acceptance safely

Baseline review:
- prepares proposals
- never creates legitimacy itself
- produces sessions (explicit or hidden)

Acceptance still happens through sessions.
Baseline review only orchestrates them.

---

## Importing and Foreign Material

Imported material is always treated as:
- foreign
- non-authoritative
- potentially incomplete

Import creates:
- review context
- provenance
- audit trails

Legitimacy is always local.
Trust is never assumed.

---

## The Full Lifecycle (Top to Bottom)

1. **Exploration**
   - Breakouts
   - Notes
   - Options
   - Questions

2. **Convergence**
   - Synthesis
   - Structured proposals
   - Discarded alternatives
   - Open issues

3. **Evaluation**
   - Sessions
   - Authority
   - Stances

4. **Legitimacy**
   - Acceptance
   - Closure
   - Audit permanence

5. **Memory**
   - Export
   - Import
   - Baseline review
   - Historical continuity

At no point does Charter:
- guess intent
- infer agreement
- erase disagreement
- shortcut legitimacy

---

## Why This Matters

Most systems collapse:
- discussion into decision
- silence into consent
- outcomes into history

Charter does the opposite.

It preserves:
- disagreement
- uncertainty
- process
- intent

Legitimacy becomes something you can *prove*, not *claim*.

---

## Final Principle

Charter does not optimize for speed.
It optimizes for **defensibility**.

If a decision mattered:
- you can explain how it happened
- who was involved
- what alternatives existed
- why this outcome was legitimate

And if you can’t —
Charter won’t pretend you can.
