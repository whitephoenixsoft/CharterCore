# Charter V6 — Layer Model and Boundaries
Version: 2.1  
Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Scope: Charter-based personal and team systems  
Purpose: Prevent category errors, authority creep, and coercive reporting  

This document defines the conceptual layers used in Charter V6.

Each layer has a distinct role.  
No layer may assume the authority of another.  
All layers are designed to **preserve legitimacy, visibility, and identity** while supporting reflection.

---

## Overview of Layers

Charter V6 operates across three complementary layers:

1. **Decision Ledger Layer** — explicit commitments and authority  
2. **Charter VDS Layer (Care & Observation)** — tracking alignment and signals  
3. **Charter VLS Layer (Identity & Lineage)** — preserving continuity and meaning  

These layers are **distinct, complementary, and non-interchangeable**.

---

## 1. Decision Ledger Layer

### Purpose
Record explicit decisions, ownership, and authority.

### What It Records
- Decisions made  
- Authority of decision-makers  
- Scope of responsibility  
- Rationale and context  
- Reversibility of decisions  
- Lineage of decisions

### What It May Do
- Preserve **immutable history**  
- Validate explicit authority  
- Represent formal commitments

### What It May Never Do
- Observe behavior or signals  
- Evaluate health or alignment  
- Generate VDS signals  
- Imply correctness, urgency, or performance

### Question It Answers
> “What was decided, by whom, and under what authority?”

---

## 2. Charter VDS Layer (Care & Observation)

### Purpose
Observe how decisions relate to reality over time and generate **reflective signals**.

### What It Observes
- Voluntary **check-ins**  
- Capacity or resource changes  
- Drift relative to declared intent  
- Signals from multiple areas and contexts  

### What It Records
- Observations  
- Signals of alignment or misalignment  
- Requests for reflection  
- Human-initiated silence  

### What It May Do
- Surface **alignment or misalignment**  
- Roll up context carefully across areas  
- Support **reflection at human-chosen cadence**  

### What It May Never Do
- Enforce action  
- Create decisions or resolutions  
- Assign blame  
- Imply urgency or coercion  

### Question It Answers
> “How are our decisions relating to reality right now?”

**VDS Notes:**  
- Signals are **descriptive, not prescriptive**  
- Multiple contributors or anonymous check-ins are supported  
- Persistent misalignment is informational, not an alert

---

## 3. Charter VLS Layer (Identity & Lineage)

### Purpose
Preserve **continuity of identity and intent** across time, teams, and changes.

### What It Observes
- Decisions from the ledger  
- Signals from VDS  
- Scope changes and mission evolution  
- Deprecation or abandonment of commitments  

### What It Records
- Identity evolution  
- Deprecated areas or intents  
- Conflicts between intent statements  
- Released or historical commitments  

### What It May Do
- Make **lineage and intent evolution visible**  
- Preserve dignity across change  
- Enable federation and comparison without coercion  

### What It May Never Do
- Observe behavior directly  
- Recommend or enforce action  
- Escalate urgency  
- Judge outcomes or assign correctness  

### Question It Answers
> “Who are we, how did we get here, and what has changed?”

**VLS Notes:**  
- Captures shifts in leadership or scope without requiring explicit communication  
- Tracks identity-level history even across rotations, temporary overlaps, or silent shifts  
- Supports auditability and organizational insight

## Team Example — All Layers Together

**Context:** Company mission → Department identity → Team Charter areas:

- Process Integrity (capacity)  
- Business Rules (operational)  

**Flow:**

1. Decisions are recorded in the **ledger**.  
2. During a sprint, **VDS signals** are generated from check-ins or observations.  
3. At review, humans reflect on signals without forced action.  
4. Over time, **VLS shows** whether:
   - an area is consistently stressed  
   - intent needs clarification  
   - scope has shifted silently  

No layer enforces behavior.  
The team chooses their own next steps.

---

## Personal Example — All Layers Together

**Context:** Personal mission → Identities:

- Career  
- Health  
- Relationships  

**Flow:**

1. Personal commitments are recorded in the **ledger**.  
2. Weekly self check-ins generate **VDS signals**.  
3. Silence is allowed when appropriate.  
4. Over time, **VLS shows**:
   - chronic overload  
   - neglected identities  
   - intentional pauses  

The system encourages **honest reflection** without self-punishment.

---

## Core Boundary Rule

- **Decisions** create legitimacy.  
- **Signals** create visibility.  
- **Lineage** creates meaning.  

If any layer collapses into another, **Charter becomes coercive**, breaking the canon.

---

## Closing Perspective

Charter is **guided journaling with memory**:

- It does **not manage people**  
- It does **not optimize lives**  
- It does **not enforce progress**  

It creates space for:

- Honest reflection  
- Dignified stagnation  
- Deliberate change  
- Human-scale responsibility  

**This is its power — and its limit.**
