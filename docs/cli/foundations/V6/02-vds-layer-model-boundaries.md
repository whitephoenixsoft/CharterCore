# Charter V6 — Layer Model and Boundaries

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Scope: Charter-based personal and team systems  
Purpose: Prevent category errors, authority creep, and coercive reporting  

This document defines the conceptual layers used in Charter V6.

Each layer has a distinct role.
No layer may assume the authority of another.

---

## Overview of Layers

Charter V6 operates across three layers:

1. Decision Ledger Layer  
2. Charter VDS Layer (Care & Observation)  
3. Charter VLS Layer (Identity & Lineage)  

These layers are complementary but not interchangeable.

---

## 1. Decision Ledger Layer

### Purpose
To record explicit decisions, commitments, and ownership.

### What It Records
- Decisions
- Authority
- Scope
- Rationale
- Reversibility
- Lineage

### What It May Do
- Preserve immutable history
- Validate authority
- Represent explicit commitment

### What It May Never Do
- Observe behavior
- Evaluate health
- Interpret progress
- Create signals

### Question It Answers
“What was decided, by whom, and under what authority?”

---

## 2. Charter VDS Layer (Care & Observation)

### Purpose
To observe how decisions relate to reality over time.

### What It Observes
- Self-reported check-ins
- Capacity changes
- Drift relative to intent
- Signals across areas

### What It Records
- Signals
- Observations
- Requests
- Silence

### What It May Do
- Surface alignment or misalignment
- Roll up context carefully
- Support reflection at chosen cadence

### What It May Never Do
- Enforce action
- Create decisions
- Assign blame
- Imply urgency

### Question It Answers
“How are our decisions relating to reality right now?”

---

## 3. Charter VLS Layer (Identity & Lineage)

### Purpose
To preserve continuity of identity and intent over time.

### What It Observes
- Decisions from the ledger
- Signals from VDS
- Scope changes
- Deprecation or abandonment

### What It Records
- Identity evolution
- Deprecated areas
- Conflicts of intent
- Released commitments

### What It May Do
- Make lineage visible
- Preserve dignity across change
- Enable federation without control

### What It May Never Do
- Observe behavior directly
- Recommend action
- Escalate urgency
- Judge outcomes

### Question It Answers
“Who are we, how did we get here, and what has changed?”

## Team Example — All Layers Together

### Context
Company mission → Department identity → Team Charter areas:
- Process Integrity (capacity)
- Business Rules (operational)

### Flow
- Decisions recorded in the ledger.
- During a sprint, signals are recorded in Charter VDS.
- At sprint review, signals are reflected on.
- Over time, VLS shows whether:
  - an area is consistently stressed
  - intent needs clarification
  - scope has shifted silently

No layer forces action.
The team chooses what to do next.

---

## Personal Example — All Layers Together

### Context
Personal mission → Identities:
- Career
- Health
- Relationships

### Flow
- Personal commitments recorded as decisions.
- Weekly self check-ins create signals.
- Silence is allowed.
- Over time, VLS shows:
  - chronic overload
  - neglected identities
  - intentional pauses

The system supports honesty without self-punishment.

---

## Core Boundary Rule

- Decisions create legitimacy.
- Signals create visibility.
- Lineage creates meaning.

If any layer collapses into another,
Charter becomes coercive.

---

## Closing Perspective

Charter is guided journaling with memory.

It does not manage people.
It does not optimize lives.
It does not enforce progress.

It creates space for:
- honest reflection
- dignified stagnation
- deliberate change
- human-scale responsibility

That is its power — and its limit.
