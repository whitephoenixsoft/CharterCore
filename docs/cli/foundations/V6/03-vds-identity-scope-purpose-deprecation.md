# Charter — Identity, Scope, Purpose, and Deprecation
Version: 2.1  
Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Applies to: Charter areas, teams, and federated decision domains  
Intent: Preserve legitimacy, continuity, and clarity in human decision-making  

This document explains how **identity, scope, purpose, and deprecation** operate in Charter.  
It adapts lessons from Value Lineage Systems (VLS) for federated human decision-making, ensuring that work, responsibilities, and decisions remain **explicit, legible, and non-coercive**.

## 1. What Charter Observes

Charter focuses on **decisions, commitments, and declared areas of responsibility**.  

It does **not** observe:

- Individual performance or productivity  
- Task completion velocity  
- Behavioral compliance  

It observes:

- **Who** owns a decision or area  
- **What** scope the area covers  
- **What** intent or purpose the area serves  
- **How** purpose evolves, narrows, expands, or is released  

Charter is concerned with **legitimacy and alignment**, not enforcement or outcomes.

## 2. Identity in Charter

### What an Identity Is

An identity represents a **bounded area of responsibility** and accountable decision-making.  
Analogous to a department, functional team, or decision domain.

An identity includes:

- Coherent **scope of influence**  
- Recognizable **purpose**  
- Ownership of **decisions within that scope**

### What an Identity Is Not

An identity does **not** refer to:

- A person or individual role (people exist within identities)  
- A single project, deployment, or temporary task  
- A system or software component  

These exist **within** identities, but they do not define them.

---

## 3. Scope and Domain

Every identity must declare:

- Its **domain of responsibility**  
- Explicit **boundaries** of authority and influence  
- Local autonomy to make decisions within its boundaries  

Without a defined scope, an area **cannot** be treated as a legitimate identity.  

Identities may **collaborate**, but they do **not dissolve** into each other.

---

## 4. Purpose and Change

Each identity has **one active purpose at a time**.  

Purpose may evolve:

- Goals may change  
- Strategies may be revised  

**Changing purpose does not replace identity**. Identity evolves only when:

- Scope or responsibilities are explicitly added or removed  
- Features or responsibilities are removed irreversibly  

These are **evolutionary changes**, not rollbacks.

---

## 5. Deprecation and Abandonment

Charter areas may contain work in three states:

### Active
- Work contributes to current purpose and intent  
- Identity, scope, and purpose are coherent  

### Deprecated
- Work continues but no longer aligns with declared purpose  
- Indicates misalignment, **not fault**  
- History and decisions are preserved for **reflection and lineage**  

### Abandoned
- Work has stopped or cannot continue  
- Result of scope change, context shift, or intentional release  
- Preserved for **learning and audit**  
- Does **not** imply failure or judgment  

Deprecation is **descriptive, not moral** — it signals a relationship to intent.

---

## 6. Why This Matters

Clear identity, scope, and purpose:

- Prevent misplaced accountability  
- Enable compassionate deprecation and intentional release  
- Make federated decisions **legible**  
- Preserve legitimacy across change  

Without identity, a team or area **cannot know who it is or what it cares about**, making alignment and federation impossible.

---

## 7. Observing Misalignment and Change

Charter encourages reflection when work diverges from declared intent:

- Does this area need clarified purpose?  
- Has scope changed without explicit acknowledgement?  
- Should deprecated work be reassigned, updated, or consciously released?  

Charter does **not**:

- Prescribe actions  
- Escalate urgency  
- Assign blame  

Instead, it surfaces **signals** so humans may deliberate intentionally.

---

## 8. Conflict Without Coercion

When multiple areas have conflicting intents:

- Conflicts are **explicit and visible**  
- No party is framed as disobedient  
- No authority is forced to intervene  

Questions to explore:

- Which intent should take priority, if any?  
- Are the intents meant to coexist?  
- Is the purpose underspecified or outdated?  

Conflict becomes **legible, not political**.

---

## 9. Federation and Scale

Most large federated systems fail because:

- Identity is implicit  
- Change is silent  
- Deprecation is hidden  
- Accountability becomes moralized  

Charter addresses this by enforcing:

- Explicit **identity and scope**  
- Explicit **purpose and intent**  
- Descriptive, **neutral language**  
- Preserved **lineage across change**  
- Separation of **observation from action**  

Result: **less blame, higher trust, clearer decision-making**.

---

## 10. Closing Perspective

Charter **is not** a management framework, a performance metric, or an authority structure.  

It is a **lineage system for human decision-making**:

- Preserves **identity, purpose, and commitments**  
- Makes **deprecation and abandonment safe and legible**  
- Provides a reflective space for **federated decision-making**  

With this framework, federated teams and individuals can **decide consciously what belongs, what can be released, and how to maintain legitimacy over time**.
