# Charter V6 — Signals, Meaning, and Non-Authority

Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Scope: All Charter-based systems (personal or team)  
Purpose: Prevent signals from becoming control, pressure, or judgment  

This document defines what **signals mean** within Charter —
and, critically, what they are **not allowed to mean**.

It exists to preserve legitimacy, agency, and trust as systems scale.

This is a semantic boundary, not a feature specification.

---

## What a Signal Is

A **signal** is a self-reported or system-observed indication of how a decision,
area, or identity relates to its declared intent, scope, or capacity.

Signals describe **relationships**, not outcomes.

A signal may indicate:
- alignment
- misalignment
- uncertainty
- reduced capacity
- intentional pause
- need for reassessment

Signals are **descriptive**, not prescriptive.

---

## What a Signal Is Not

A signal is **never**:

- a command  
- an obligation  
- a task  
- a performance metric  
- a severity level  
- a promise of action  
- a judgment of effort or quality  

Signals do not imply urgency.  
Signals do not require response.  
Signals do not decay into enforcement.

---

## Signals and Authority

Signals **carry no authority**.

- They do not override decisions.
- They do not create deadlines.
- They do not escalate by themselves.
- They do not bind others to act.

Only explicit decisions, recorded as commits, create legitimacy.

---

## Non-Comparability of Signals

Signals are **not comparable**.

There is no:
- “more severe” signal
- “higher priority” signal
- “worse” signal
- global ordering

Multiple signals increase **context**, not pressure.

More visibility ≠ more urgency.

---

## Silence Is a First-Class Signal

Silence is not absence.
Silence is not neglect.
Silence is not compliance.

Silence may indicate:
- stability
- acceptance of current conditions
- constrained capacity
- deferred attention
- nothing new worth elevating

Silence is always legitimate.

---

## Signals vs Requests

A **signal** describes.
A **request** invites deliberation.

Requests:
- carry no authority
- carry no deadline
- may be ignored without penalty

Signals may inspire requests.
Requests never obligate response.

## Signals in Teams — Example

### Context
A product team has two Charter areas:
- **Process Integrity**
- **Business Rules**

During a sprint:
- The Scrum Master notices a process rule was violated.
- An analyst realizes a business rule was violated late in the sprint.

### Signals
- A signal is recorded against *Process Integrity*:
  “Observation noted; decision unchanged.”
- A signal is recorded against *Business Rules*:
  “Reassessment requested.”

No blame.
No urgency.
No enforcement.

### Review
At sprint review and retro:
- The team reflects on signals together.
- A backlog item is created for the business rule.
- The process issue is discussed, not escalated.

Signals created **visibility**, not pressure.

---

## Signals for Individuals — Example

### Context
A person maintains personal Charter areas:
- Health
- Career
- Family

They notice reduced capacity due to illness.

### Signals
- Health area: “Capacity reduced.”
- Career area: “Paused intentionally.”
- Family area: silence.

No task list is generated.
No failure is recorded.
No justification is required.

The signals preserve **honest self-awareness**, not productivity theater.

---

## Federation and Signals

When signals roll up:
- Context must be preserved.
- Detail is summarized only if intent is affected.
- No downstream authority is created.

Federation amplifies **understanding**, not control.

---

## Core Rule

No signal is a command.  
No request is an obligation.  
No silence is an error.

If this rule is violated, the system is no longer Charter-compatible.

---

## Closing Perspective

Signals exist to make reflection possible —
not to make action inevitable.

They protect humans from:
- status theater
- coercive reporting
- false urgency
- moralized progress

Signals train perception, not behavior.

Legitimacy depends on this restraint.
