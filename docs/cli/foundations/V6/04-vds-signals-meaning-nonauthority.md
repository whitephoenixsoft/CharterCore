# Charter V6 — Signals, Meaning, and Non-Authority
Version: 2.1  
Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Scope: All Charter-based systems (personal or team)  
Purpose: Prevent signals from becoming control, pressure, or judgment  

This document defines what **signals mean** within Charter —  
and, critically, what they are **not allowed to mean**.  

It exists to preserve **legitimacy, agency, and trust** as systems scale.  
This is a **semantic boundary**, not a feature specification.

## What a Signal Is

A **signal** is a voluntary, human-reported or observed indication of how a decision, area, or identity relates to its **declared intent, scope, or capacity**.

Signals describe **relationships**, not outcomes.

A signal may indicate:

- Alignment  
- Misalignment  
- Uncertainty  
- Reduced capacity  
- Intentional pause  
- Need for reassessment  

**Key Principle:** Signals are **descriptive**, not prescriptive.

---

## What a Signal Is Not

A signal is **never**:

- A command or mandate  
- An obligation  
- A task to complete  
- A performance metric  
- A severity or priority level  
- A promise of action  
- A judgment of effort or quality  

Signals **do not imply urgency**.  
Signals **do not require response**.  
Signals **cannot enforce behavior**.

---

## Signals and Authority

Signals **carry no authority**:

- They do not override decisions  
- They do not create deadlines  
- They do not escalate automatically  
- They do not bind others to act  

Only **explicit decisions**, recorded as **commits**, create legitimacy.

---

## Non-Comparability of Signals

Signals are **not comparable**:

- No “more severe” or “higher priority” exists  
- No global ordering or scoring is implied  

Multiple signals **increase context**, not pressure.  
More visibility ≠ more urgency.

---

## Silence as a First-Class Signal

Silence is **valid and meaningful**:

- Not absence  
- Not neglect  
- Not compliance  

Silence may indicate:

- Stability or alignment  
- Acceptance of current conditions  
- Constrained capacity  
- Deferred attention  
- Nothing new to report  

**Key Principle:** Silence is legitimate, but may inform reflection or check-ins.

---

## Signals vs Requests

- **Signal:** Describes status, alignment, or change  
- **Request:** Invites deliberation or consideration  

Requests:

- Carry no authority  
- Carry no deadline  
- May be ignored without penalty  

Signals may inspire requests.  
Requests **never create obligations**.

---

## Signals in Teams — Example

### Context
A product team has two Charter areas:

- **Process Integrity**  
- **Business Rules**  

During a sprint:

- Scrum Master observes a process violation  
- Analyst observes a business rule violation late in the sprint

### Signals
- *Process Integrity*: “Observation noted; decision unchanged.”  
- *Business Rules*: “Reassessment requested.”

No blame.  
No urgency.  
No enforcement.

### Review
At sprint retro:

- Team reflects on signals  
- Backlog items are created if needed  
- Process deviations are discussed, not escalated  

Signals create **visibility**, not pressure.

---

## Signals for Individuals — Example

### Context
A person maintains personal Charter areas:

- Health  
- Career  
- Family  

They experience reduced capacity due to illness.

### Signals
- Health: “Capacity reduced”  
- Career: “Paused intentionally”  
- Family: Silence

No tasks are generated.  
No failures are recorded.  
No justification is required.

Signals preserve **honest self-awareness**, not productivity theater.

---

## Federation and Signals

When signals roll up across federated areas:

- Context is preserved  
- Summaries reflect **intent impact**, not raw metrics  
- No downstream authority or obligation is created  

Federation amplifies **understanding**, not control.

---

## Core Rule

- No signal is a command  
- No request is an obligation  
- No silence is an error  

Violation of this principle makes the system **non-Charter-compliant**.

---

## Closing Perspective

Signals exist to make **reflection possible**, not action inevitable.

They protect humans from:

- Status theater  
- Coercive reporting  
- False urgency  
- Moralized progress  

Signals train **perception**, not behavior.  
Legitimacy depends on this restraint.
