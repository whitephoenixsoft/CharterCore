# Charter V6 — Audit and Artifact Policy
**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL  
**Scope:** All commit types, check-ins, annotations, and baseline reviews  
**Purpose:** Define auditable artifacts and practices to preserve legitimacy, traceability, and reflection

---

## 1. Definition of Artifacts

An **artifact** is any human-initiated or system-recorded commit that preserves:

- Decisions  
- Observations  
- Annotations  
- Silence (Type A check-ins)

Artifacts are **immutable** and **auditable** by design.

**Examples:**

- Resolution commit  
- Check-in commit  
- Baseline review commit  
- Annotation commit  

---

## 2. Artifact Requirements

Each artifact must contain, at minimum:

- **Timestamp**: when it was created  
- **Area reference(s)**: which Charter area(s) it concerns  
- **Commit type**: resolution, check-in, annotation, baseline review  
- **Author/identity alias**: optional, human-assigned or repository identity  
- **Rationale/annotation**: optional, for context and insight  
- **Parent or reference commits**: to preserve lineage

Artifacts **must not be altered** once recorded. Changes require a new commit referencing the original.

---

## 3. Auditable Events

Auditability applies to:

- Creation of commits  
- Updates to area boundaries or scope (via commits)  
- Check-ins and Type A silence  
- Annotation additions  

Artifacts provide **historical evidence** for:

- Reflection  
- Federation analysis  
- Compliance or organizational learning  

---

## 4. Human-Explicit Silence

- Silence (Type A) is treated as a **legitimate artifact** if recorded explicitly  
- Type B (no check-in) is **not automatically auditable**  
- Only **human-initiated confirmations** produce auditable evidence of alignment  

---

## 5. Artifact Integrity Principles

1. **Immutability** — History cannot be rewritten.  
2. **Transparency** — Optional annotations provide context without coercion.  
3. **Traceability** — Artifacts reference areas, parents, and identities.  
4. **Non-authoritative** — Artifacts do not imply enforcement, urgency, or performance metrics.  

---

## 6. Closing Perspective

Artifacts are **Charter’s memory**.  
They preserve:

- Decisions and observations  
- Team and individual history  
- Reflections without judgment  

Auditability ensures that **legitimacy and lineage are durable** across time, federation, and organizational change.
