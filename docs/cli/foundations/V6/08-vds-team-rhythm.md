# Charter V6 — Deployment Window & Team Rhythm Guide
**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL  
**Scope:** VDS check-ins, team reflection, and cadence observation  
**Purpose:** Provide guidance for observing natural team rhythms without control or coercion

---

## 1. Observing Team Cadence

- Deployment windows or reporting cycles can be **tracked as a health signal**  
- These observations do **not enforce schedules** or deadlines  
- Timing is **human-determined** and flexible  

---

## 2. Use Cases

- Map **high and low activity periods** across areas  
- Detect **silent drift** or unobserved misalignment  
- Provide context for **retrospectives or reflection sessions**  

---

## 3. Check-In Timing

- Check-ins remain **voluntary and human-paced**  
- Recommended frequency enhances insight but is never required  
- Single individuals may submit check-ins for multiple areas  

---

## 4. Interaction With Federation

- VDS may aggregate check-ins across the team to **highlight patterns**  
- Federation preserves **all context and annotations**  
- Silence is included as **Type A artifacts** when explicitly noted  

---

## 5. Principles

1. **Human-paced** — Team members decide when and how to report  
2. **Non-coercive** — Observing cadence never implies urgency or failure  
3. **Reflective, not prescriptive** — Signals about rhythms inform, but do not mandate action  
4. **Audit-ready** — Explicit timing of check-ins can serve as historical evidence  

---

## 6. Closing Perspective

Tracking deployment windows and team rhythms allows **teams to observe themselves honestly**:

- Identify potential overload  
- Reflect on alignment without pressure  
- Provide historical context for future federation  

Charter preserves **autonomy, visibility, and continuity** while enabling reflection on team dynamics.
