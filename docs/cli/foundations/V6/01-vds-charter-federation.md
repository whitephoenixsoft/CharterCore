# Federation of Charter Areas (V6)
Version: 2.1  
Status: FOUNDATION  
Applies to: Teams, individuals, or federated decision domains using Charter V6  
Enforced by: Humans; optionally supported by guidance engines  

---

## Purpose

This document defines how **multiple Charter areas**—each representing a bounded domain of responsibility—may be federated to support:

- Honest self-reporting of alignment  
- Reflective assessment of decision health  
- Coordination across mission-aligned areas without enforcement  
- Preservation of legitimacy across distributed decision-making  

Federation in Charter exists to **increase visibility without increasing pressure**.  
It is observational, **not managerial**, and explicitly designed to preserve human agency.  

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Charter Area

A **Charter area** is a bounded domain of decisions with:

- Explicit ownership  
- Declared intent  
- Independent lineage  
- Local accountability  

Examples include:

- Team processes  
- System business rules  
- Operational responsibilities  
- Personal life domains  

Areas may interact or depend on one another, but **no authority is merged implicitly**.  
Federation preserves autonomy while supporting **legible alignment across areas**.

**Identity Note:** All check-ins, annotations, and observations are tied to the area or repository identity, not the individual user, preserving **anonymity while remaining auditable**.

---

### 2. Decision Health

**Decision health** reflects how existing decisions relate to declared intent and current conditions.

It does **not** measure:

- Performance  
- Productivity  
- Compliance  
- Correctness  

Decision health is observed through **check-ins**, using descriptive states.

**Illustrative enums include:**

- `Intent Unchanged`  
- `Capacity Reduced`  
- `Action Taken`  
- `Observations Inconclusive`  
- `Paused Intentionally`  
- `Reassessment Requested`  

These states describe **relationship to intent**, not success or failure.

**Key Principle:** Decision health signals are **directional, not prescriptive**.  
They provide information for reflection and care, not alerts when alignment is positive.

---

### 3. Check-Ins as Artifacts

A **check-in** is a voluntary, human-initiated observation about a decision or area.  

Check-ins:

- Are auditable **artifacts**  
- Include **optional annotations and rationale** for context  
- Record both **differences** and **observed continuities**  
- Reflect **alignment, drift, or capacity changes**, not performance  

**Value of artifact check-ins:**

- Serve as historical evidence for **reflection, research, or accountability**  
- Enable **auditability** across time, teams, or organizational change  
- Support insights for **team cohesion, identity shifts, cross-area dependencies, and autonomous behavior**  

**Voting & Discrete Check-Ins:**  
Teams may submit **anonymous or individual check-ins** (e.g., during retrospectives) instead of collective reporting.  
This preserves **honest individual perspectives** and captures more accurate alignment data.

---

### 4. Silence Handling

Silence is **first-class and meaningful**:

1. **Type A — Check-In Silence:**  
   - Explicit human entry noting no differences or changes in observed areas  
   - Ensures **auditable confirmation of alignment**  

2. **Type B — No Check-In Silence:**  
   - No check-in recorded  
   - Preserves **free agency**; **not automatically logged**  
   - Humans may decide to log silence as a checkpoint for visibility  

**Principle:** Only **human-initiated silence** is auditable.  
Automatic entries are avoided to **protect autonomy**, but persistent absence of check-ins can serve as a **care signal for reflection**, not a performance metric.

---

### 5. Federation

**Federation** aggregates signals across Charter areas to produce a **higher-level view of decision health**.

Federation:

- Summarizes **without flattening context**  
- Preserves **local ownership**  
- Never issues directives, assigns blame, or escalates urgency  
- Supports reflection, not intervention  

**Annotations & Context:**  
- Strongly encouraged to capture **interactions between teams, dependencies, or overlapping areas**  
- Enables insights into organizational cohesion and potential conflicts  

**Redundancy / Multi-VDS:**  
- Organizations may maintain multiple VDS for the same identity for **redundancy or resilience**  
- **Context annotations** distinguish signals between VDS instances and allow observation of conflicting inputs

---

### 6. Deployment Windows & Team Rhythms

Federation may reference **team cadence or reporting cycles** to:

- Map **natural team rhythms**  
- Detect periods of high or low activity/alignment  
- Serve as a **health signal**, not a control mechanism  

**Human judgment** drives timing and observation.  
VDS does **not enforce schedules** or generate mandatory actions.

---

### 7. Persistent Misalignment

- Signals **observable divergence from declared intent**  
- Does **not imply a problem**, but identifies areas for reflection  
- Humans decide whether clarification, intervention, or conversation is warranted  

**Organizational Insight:** Persistent misalignment can reveal **unseen gaps, shifts in leadership decisions, or breakdowns in communication**, while maintaining a descriptive, non-coercive perspective.

---

### 8. Operational vs Capacity Decisions

Charter distinguishes between:

- **Operational decisions** — tied directly to mission outcomes (e.g., business rules, correctness constraints)  
- **Capacity decisions** — governing capability, availability, or coverage  

Check-ins preserve this distinction **without implying performance judgment**, but provide early visibility into resource constraints or team readiness.

---

### 9. Principles of Federation

1. **Self-Reporting Is Safe** — Check-ins and annotations are voluntary and non-punitive  
2. **Aggregation Is Not Enforcement** — Visibility does not create obligation  
3. **Decision Health Is Inspectable** — Signals remain traceable by area, time, and type  
4. **Legitimacy Over Optimization** — Clarity and ownership take precedence over speed or output  
5. **Cadence Is Human-Chosen** — Reflection and check-ins occur at team-determined intervals  
6. **Artifacts Are Auditable** — Check-ins are historical records, including optional rationale and commentary  
7. **Annotations Preserve Context** — Especially where teams’ decisions intersect  
8. **Discrete & Anonymous Inputs Are Supported** — Enables honest perspectives without compromising privacy  

---

### 10. Illustrative Flow

1. A decision exists within a Charter area  
2. Work proceeds  
3. A human observes alignment relative to declared intent  
4. A **check-in is recorded** (or human-initiated silence is noted)  
5. Federation summarizes decision health across areas, preserving annotations and context  
6. Humans reflect and decide whether action is needed  
7. All check-ins remain **auditable artifacts**, including rationale if provided  

At no point does the system mandate behavior.  
All escalation is **informational and descriptive**, not coercive.

---

### Closing Principle

Federation of Charter areas enables:

- Early visibility without early escalation  
- Shared understanding without shared control  
- Honest reflection without status theater  
- Distributed agency without fragmentation  

It operationalizes the core VDS insight:

> Systems remain legitimate  
> when they observe themselves honestly  
> and change only when they mean to.

**Tie-In to VDS & VLS:**  
- VDS consumes check-ins to generate alignment or care signals  
- VLS can consume aggregated insights for identity-level lineage or historical context  
- Neither layer introduces coercion; **all meaning and legitimacy remain local**
