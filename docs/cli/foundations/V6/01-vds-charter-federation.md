# Federation of Charter Areas
Version: 1.0  
Status: FOUNDATION  
Applies to: Teams, individuals, or federated decision domains using Charter V6  
Enforced by: Humans, optionally supported by guidance engines

---

## Purpose

This document defines how **multiple Charter areas**—each representing a bounded domain of responsibility—may be federated to support:

- Honest self-reporting of alignment
- Reflective assessment of decision health
- Coordination across mission-aligned areas without enforcement
- Preservation of legitimacy across distributed decision-making

Federation in Charter exists to **increase visibility without increasing pressure**.

It is observational, not managerial.

---

## Core Concepts

### 1. Charter Area

A **Charter area** is a bounded domain of decisions with:

- Explicit ownership
- Declared intent
- Independent lineage
- Local accountability

Examples include:
- Team processes
- System business rules
- Operational responsibilities
- Personal life domains

Areas may depend on one another, but they do not dissolve into a single authority.

Federation preserves autonomy.

---

### 2. Decision Health

**Decision health** reflects how existing decisions relate to declared intent and current conditions.

It does not measure:
- performance
- productivity
- compliance
- correctness

Decision health is observed through **check-ins**, using descriptive states.

**Illustrative enums include:**
- `Intent Unchanged`
- `Capacity Reduced`
- `Action Taken`
- `Observations Inconclusive`
- `Paused Intentionally`
- `Reassessment Requested`

These states describe **relationship to intent**, not success or failure.

---

### 3. Check-Ins

A **check-in** is a voluntary, self-reported observation about a decision or area.

Check-ins:
- may be submitted by individuals or groups
- may occur at any time
- may also be reviewed collectively at natural cadence points

Check-ins are encouraged to be psychologically safe.

Examples:
- A business rule violation noticed mid-sprint
- A process deviation noted for later reflection
- A capacity constraint newly recognized
- A realization that a decision was not being followed as assumed

Multiple check-ins within a configured time window may be coalesced.
Redundancy increases confidence, not severity.

---

### 4. Federation

**Federation** aggregates signals across Charter areas to produce a higher-level view of decision health.

Federation:
- summarizes without flattening context
- preserves local ownership
- never issues directives
- never assigns blame
- never escalates urgency

Federated views exist to support **reflection**, not intervention.

Humans decide what—if anything—happens next.

## Example: Team Federation

### Charter Areas
1. Team Processes  
2. System Business Rules  

### During a Sprint
- A feature is released successfully
- The Scrum Master notices a process deviation and submits a check-in
- An analyst notices a business rule violation and submits a check-in immediately

### Federated View
At sprint review and retro:
- Business rule signals inform backlog prioritization
- Process signals inform retrospective discussion
- No signal forces action
- No signal implies failure

The team receives an **honest picture of decision health**, not a scorecard.

Legitimacy is preserved.
Agency remains local.

---

## Operational vs Capacity Decisions

Charter distinguishes between:

- **Operational decisions**  
  Decisions tied directly to mission outcomes  
  (e.g., business rules, correctness constraints)

- **Capacity decisions**  
  Decisions governing human or organizational capability  
  (e.g., coverage, role backups, availability)

Check-ins allow this distinction to remain visible.

Example:
If all designated backups are unavailable due to scheduling,
a `Reassessment Requested` check-in reflects a **capacity misalignment** —
not a performance failure.

---

## Principles of Federation

1. **Self-Reporting Is Safe**  
   Check-ins are voluntary and non-punitive.

2. **Aggregation Is Not Enforcement**  
   Visibility does not create obligation.

3. **Decision Health Is Inspectable**  
   Signals remain traceable by area, time, and type.

4. **Legitimacy Over Optimization**  
   The system values clarity and ownership over speed or output.

5. **Cadence Is Human-Chosen**  
   Reflection may occur at sprint review, retro, milestones, or ad hoc.
   Cadence is never imposed by the system.

---

## Illustrative Flow

1. A decision exists within a Charter area
2. Work proceeds
3. An observation is made
4. A check-in is recorded (or silence is maintained)
5. Federation summarizes decision health
6. Humans reflect and decide whether to act
7. Decisions and signals remain auditable over time

At no point does the system mandate behavior.

---

## Closing Principle

Federation of Charter areas enables:

- Early visibility without early escalation
- Shared understanding without shared control
- Honest reflection without status theater
- Distributed agency without fragmentation

It operationalizes the core VDS insight:

> Systems remain legitimate  
> when they observe themselves honestly  
> and change only when they mean to.
