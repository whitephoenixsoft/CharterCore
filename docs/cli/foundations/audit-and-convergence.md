# Audit, Breakouts, and Synthesis  
## How Charter Remembers Without Deciding

This document explains **how Charter observes and records reality** without prematurely deciding it.

It exists to guide future specifications — especially auditing — by clarifying the *roles* of:
- breakouts
- synthesis
- baselines
- sessions
- audit itself

This is not a workflow.
This is not a UI guide.
This is a mental model.

---

## The Core Principle

Charter distinguishes between:

- **Exploration** (thinking, learning, generating)
- **Convergence** (shaping, consolidating, preparing)
- **Legitimacy** (deciding, accepting, committing)

Audit must span all three —  
but **legitimacy exists only in the last**.

---

## Moments in Time, Not Streams

A breakout is not an ongoing state.
A session is not an ongoing state.
A synthesis is not an ongoing state.

Each is a **bounded moment in time** with:
- a start
- a set of participants
- a set of inputs
- a set of outputs
- an end

Audit records **that the moment happened** — not whether it was correct.

This is why breakouts make sense:
they are *recorded moments of exploration*.

---

## Breakouts: Recorded Exploration

Breakouts exist to explore without deciding.

They:
- do not vote
- do not accept
- do not reject
- do not create legitimacy

A breakout may produce **multiple artifacts**, including:
- draft resolution text
- option lists
- tradeoff summaries
- risk notes
- unanswered questions
- action items
- recommendations
- requests for further exploration

These artifacts:
- have identity
- are auditable
- are referenceable
- carry **zero authority**

Breakouts answer:
> “What did we learn?”

They never answer:
> “What should we do?”

---

## Restarting Breakouts

Because breakouts are moments, not streams:

- restarting a breakout:
  - closes the original breakout
  - preserves all prior artifacts
  - creates a new breakout with explicit lineage
  - begins with a clean artifact set

Nothing is erased.
Nothing is overwritten.
Learning accumulates.

---

## Synthesis: Convergence Without Authority

Synthesis exists between exploration and legitimacy.

It:
- consumes breakout artifacts
- shapes them into structured proposals
- records discarded alternatives
- documents remaining uncertainty

Synthesis does **not**:
- vote
- accept
- reject
- evaluate authority

Synthesis answers:
> “What are the coherent options worth judging?”

It prepares material — it does not judge it.

---

## Relationship to Baseline Review

Synthesis is intentionally similar to baseline review in *shape*:

- both consolidate multiple inputs
- both produce reviewable artifacts
- both are auditable
- neither creates legitimacy directly

Key difference:
- **Baseline review evaluates foreign or historical material**
- **Synthesis evaluates exploratory material created locally**

Both must end explicitly.

Both may:
- finalize outputs
- or kick work back for further breakouts

---

## From Synthesis to Legitimacy

Once synthesis produces proposals:

- those proposals may:
  - enter a baseline review
  - or be introduced into sessions
  - or be deferred entirely

Legitimacy is created only when:
- a session evaluates a proposal
- authority is applied
- acceptance occurs

Audit does not confuse preparation with decision.

---

## What Audit Must Preserve

Audit exists to reconstruct reality, not intent.

It must always be possible to answer:

- What exploration occurred?
- Who participated?
- What artifacts were produced?
- How were those artifacts shaped?
- Which artifacts became proposals?
- Which proposals became decisions?
- Which ones did not — and why?

Breakouts, synthesis, baselines, and sessions are all first-class audit subjects.

Legitimacy is not assumed.
It is proven.

---

## Why This Matters

Without breakouts:
- exploration leaks into sessions
- voting pressure appears too early
- decisions become brittle

Without synthesis:
- exploration becomes noise
- proposals lack context
- authority is forced to arbitrate ambiguity

Without audit:
- legitimacy becomes performative
- history collapses into outcomes
- trust erodes silently

Charter preserves trust by remembering **everything**,  
and legitimizing **almost nothing**.

---

## Final Note

If something feels “unfinished” here, that is intentional.

Exploration is allowed to be incomplete.
Convergence is allowed to be uncomfortable.
Legitimacy is allowed to be slow.

Audit does not rush reality.
It records it.
