# Charter V5 AI Guidance — Design Defense
**Status:** Informational / Design Rationale  
**Applies to:** Charter Guidance Layer (V5+)  
**Not a Specification. Not a Canon. Not Enforced.**

---

## 1. Purpose & Audience

This document exists to explain **why** Charter V5’s AI guidance layer is designed the way it is — and what boundaries it intentionally refuses to cross.

It is written for:
- users who are cautious or skeptical of AI
- reviewers evaluating Charter for workplace or institutional use
- contributors who may extend guidance functionality
- future maintainers (including future self)

This document does not define behavior.  
It explains design intent and ethical constraints.

## 2. The Concern Is Reasonable

Skepticism toward AI-assisted systems is justified.

Common concerns include:
- AI making or steering decisions instead of humans
- opaque inference or hidden optimization
- subtle persuasion or norm-setting through language
- loss of agency or accountability
- workplace risk from undocumented influence

Charter treats these concerns as **valid design inputs**, not objections to be dismissed.

V5 exists specifically because these risks are real.

## 3. What Charter V5 AI Is — and Is Not

### What It Is

Charter V5 AI guidance:
- explains immutable Charter history in human terms
- summarizes sessions, resolutions, scope, and authority context
- surfaces gaps, ambiguity, or missing annotations
- helps users understand what they have done over time

### What It Is Not

Charter V5 AI guidance does **not**:
- decide
- recommend actions or outcomes
- rank options
- infer intent, motivation, or emotion
- create, modify, or legitimize decisions
- mutate engine state
- block valid human actions

If guidance output conflicts with engine facts, **guidance is wrong**.

## 4. Authority & Legitimacy Remain Human

Charter enforces a strict authority hierarchy:

1. **Charter Core Engine**  
   The sole source of legitimacy. Mechanical, deterministic, immutable.

2. **User Canon**  
   The body of accepted resolutions and governance history.

3. **Legitimacy Canon**  
   Governs how legitimacy may be interpreted or explained.

4. **Guidance (V5)**  
   Reads only. Explains only. Never acts.

AI guidance has **no authority**, explicit or implicit.  
Removing or disabling AI does not weaken Charter’s correctness, legitimacy, or auditability.

---

## 5. Why This Is Not “Soft Control”

Many AI systems influence behavior through:
- optimization framing
- implicit value ranking
- emotional mirroring
- persuasive language
- false completeness

Charter V5 explicitly rejects these mechanisms.

Design constraints include:
- no normativity (“better”, “worse”, “should”)
- no optimization language
- no emotional or psychological inference
- no forced coherence
- no resolution of ambiguity unless humans record it
- terminal explanations may end in “unknown”

Unresolved ambiguity is treated as a **valid outcome**, not a failure.

---

## 6. Optionality & Refusal Are First-Class

AI guidance in Charter:
- is **off by default**
- requires explicit configuration (local model or API)
- can be disabled permanently
- can be ignored at any moment

Charter remains fully usable, legitimate, and auditable without AI.

Using Charter does **not** morally, professionally, or structurally bind a user to AI use.

---

## 7. Workplace Use & Audit Clarity

In organizational environments:

- all decisions remain provably human
- audit trails record authority, participation, and acceptance — not AI influence
- guidance is not part of the acceptance path
- organizations may forbid AI use without breaking Charter workflows

AI guidance leaves **no hidden footprint** in legitimacy.

---

## 8. What This Design Is Trying to Protect

Charter V5 AI guidance is designed to support:
- clarity without judgment
- ownership without shame
- confidence in past decisions
- courage to revise without erasing history

It does not aim to produce better decisions.
It aims to make decisions **understandable and defensible** over time.

Any growth that results is optional.

---

## 9. Final Boundary Statement

Charter V5 AI guidance exists to **explain history**, not to shape it.

If guidance ever feels:
- authoritative
- persuasive
- unavoidable
- judgmental

then it has failed its purpose.

Legitimacy remains human.
Understanding is optional.
History is untouched.
