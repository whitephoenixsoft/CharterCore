# Charter V5 — AI Guidance Phases

**Status:** FOUNDATIONAL  
**Scope:** Charter Guidance Layer (V5+)  
**Does NOT Define:** Legitimacy creation, voting, authority inference, decision enforcement

---

## 1. Purpose

The V5 Guidance layer exists to provide **assistance, exegesis, and structured reflection** over the immutable state of Charter.  

It is strictly:

- **Read-only** — does not create, modify, or reject resolutions  
- **Non-directive** — may highlight patterns or options but never recommend actions  
- **Subordinate** — guidance respects all V1–V4 and V5 invariants, including auditability and authority boundaries  

The guidance layer supports:

- Understanding historical decisions and resolutions  
- Surfacing assumptions, drift, and inconsistencies  
- Structured reflective workflows via **phases**  
- Optional AI voice/personality to clarify explanations  

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Non-Blocking** — guidance never prevents valid human actions  
2. **Advisory Only** — outputs are for explanation, not for authority or coercion  
3. **Temporal Awareness** — all insights respect the time of acceptance and historical context  
4. **Psychological Safety** — guidance is neutral, non-judgmental, and non-normative  
5. **Optionality** — AI guidance may be disabled at any time without affecting correctness or auditability  
6. **Explicitness** — every phase or personality change must be announced, including pros, cons, and effects  

---

## 3. Heuristics

Guidance operates using **heuristics** that are:

- **Invariant** — defined independently of personality or phase  
- **Non-authoritative** — cannot create legitimacy or override decisions  
- **Context-aware** — surfaces annotations, assumptions, or contradictions without inference  
- **Composable** — multiple heuristics may apply simultaneously  

Heuristics include:

- Authority Awareness  
- Scope Boundary Alignment  
- Temporal Framing  
- Divergence Highlighting  
- Annotation Presence / Absence  
- Pattern Emergence  
- Assumption Surfacing  

---

## 4. Personality

Guidance may be rendered in **user-configured personalities**, affecting:

- Tone (e.g., calm, neutral, supportive)  
- Density of explanation  
- Presentation style  

**Constraints:**

- Personality **must not alter meaning**  
- Guidance output remains advisory  
- Personality is optional and configurable  

---

## 5. Phases

V5 introduces **structured phases** to guide reflection, exploration, and synthesis.  

### 5.1 Phase Characteristics

- Each **phase** has a default assignment based on context (e.g., deliberate breakouts, solo work, group reasoning)  
- Users may **override phases** explicitly during deliberate workflows  
- Phase changes **must be announced** with pros, cons, and expected behaviors  
- Multiple phases may be applied in sequence or combination to support complex workflows  

### 5.2 Phase Functions

| Phase Function | Purpose | Typical Context |
|----------------|---------|----------------|
| **Expansion** | Generate ideas, surface options, explore possibilities | Brainstorming, Self-Discovery, Deliberate Breakouts |
| **Structuring** | Organize ideas, clarify logic, link options | Development, Group Reasoning, Epic Planning |
| **Divergence Highlight** | Surface contradictions, misalignment, or drift | Group Reasoning, Scientific Research |
| **Synthesis** | Merge insights, converge options, prepare for baseline review | Development, Deliberate Synthesis |
| **Temporal Reflection** | Review historical patterns, track evolution over time | Scientific Research, Solo Work, Self-Discovery |
| **Assumption Tracking** | Explicitly identify underlying assumptions and constraints | Scientific Research, Solo Work, Deliberate Workflows |

**Notes:**

- Phases are **process descriptors**, not goals or mandates  
- Drift is allowed in non-legitimate phases; synthesis and baseline review reconverge toward deliberate proposals  
- Phase function is **independent of personality**  

---

## 6. Integration with Deliberate Workflows

- Deliberate epics provide a **structured container** for proposals and breakouts  
- Options generated may be:

  - Questions  
  - Hypotheses  
  - Draft proposals  

- AI phases guide exploration and reflection **without creating legitimacy**  
- Once breakouts are synthesized, **baseline review** enforces legitimacy via mechanical voting  

---

## 7. Optionality and Overrides

- AI guidance may be **turned off at any point**  
- Phase changes are optional and user-controlled, except in phases tied to sessions enforcing legitimacy  
- Personality may be changed or disabled independently of phase  
- Heuristics remain active regardless of AI presence to preserve explanatory consistency  

---

## 8. Auditing and Transparency

- All guidance outputs are **auditable artifacts**: phase announcements, personality settings, and explanatory notes  
- Drift and assumptions surfaced by guidance are **recorded but non-authoritative**  
- Users retain **full agency**; guidance never substitutes for mechanical decisions  

---

## 9. Closing Principle

Charter V5 guidance exists to:

- Clarify what has happened  
- Expose assumptions and patterns  
- Support structured, reflective workflows  
- Maintain psychological safety and non-coercion  

> Guidance explains. Humans decide. Legitimacy remains local.
