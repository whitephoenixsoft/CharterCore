# Audit, Breakouts, and Synthesis  
## How Charter Remembers Without Deciding

This document explains **how Charter records human activity** without turning it into decisions.

It exists to guide future specifications — especially auditing — by clarifying the *roles and boundaries* of:
- breakouts
- options
- synthesis
- baselines
- sessions
- audit itself

This is not a workflow.
This is not a UI guide.
This is a mental model.

## The Core Principle

Charter distinguishes between three fundamentally different human activities:

- **Exploration** — thinking, learning, questioning, drafting
- **Convergence** — structuring, grouping, refining, preparing
- **Legitimacy** — deciding, accepting, committing

Audit must span all three.

**Legitimacy exists only in the last.**

Everything before legitimacy is memory.

## Moments in Time, Not Streams

A breakout is not an ongoing state.  
A session is not an ongoing state.  
A synthesis is not an ongoing state.

Each is a **bounded moment in time** with:
- a start
- a declared context
- a set of participants (if any)
- a set of inputs
- a set of outputs
- an explicit end

Audit records **that the moment occurred** —  
not whether it was correct, complete, or successful.

Charter records moments so that humans can revisit them later
without rewriting history.

## Breakouts: Recorded Exploration

Breakouts exist to explore without deciding.

They:
- do not vote
- do not accept
- do not reject
- do not evaluate authority
- do not create legitimacy

A breakout may produce **any number of artifacts**, including:
- draft resolution text
- option descriptions
- problem statements
- tradeoff notes
- risks and concerns
- unanswered questions
- action items
- recommendations
- follow-up prompts

These artifacts:
- have identity
- are auditable
- are referenceable
- carry **zero authority**

Breakouts answer:
> “What happened during this exploration?”

They never answer:
> “What should be decided?”

Breakouts are **guided note-taking with receipts**.

---

## Options: Exploratory Placeholders

Options represent **things worth thinking about**, not things worth deciding.

An option may be:
- a proposed solution
- a question
- a concern
- a hypothesis
- a direction
- a reframing of the problem

Options:
- may be created explicitly before a breakout
- may emerge during a breakout
- may change meaning over time
- may be closed, deferred, or replaced

Options are **mutable during exploration**.

They are not commitments.
They are not candidates.
They are not proposals.

They are memory anchors.

---

## Restarting Breakouts

Because breakouts are moments, not streams:

- restarting a breakout:
  - closes the prior breakout
  - preserves all produced artifacts
  - records explicit lineage
  - begins a new exploratory moment

Nothing is erased.
Nothing is overwritten.
Earlier thinking remains visible — even if abandoned.

This ensures audit reflects *how understanding evolved*, not just where it landed.

---

## Synthesis: Convergence Without Authority

Synthesis is not a vote.
It is not a decision.
It is not a command.

Synthesis is the act of **structuring what already exists**.

It:
- groups related breakout artifacts
- refines language
- separates alternatives
- records discarded paths
- identifies unresolved questions
- clarifies readiness

Synthesis does **not**:
- accept
- reject
- override
- interpret authority

Synthesis answers:
> “What are the things we now understand well enough to judge?”

Synthesis may happen:
- incrementally
- implicitly
- repeatedly

Its effects must be **auditable**, even if the act itself is not exposed as a standalone command.

---

## Relationship to Baseline Review

Baseline review is the **universal consolidation boundary** in Charter.

It exists wherever:
- work is imported
- work is merged
- work is handed off
- work is prepared for legitimacy

Synthesis and baseline review are similar in shape:
- both consolidate multiple inputs
- both are auditable
- both prepare material for sessions
- neither creates legitimacy

Key distinction:
- **Synthesis structures local exploratory material**
- **Baseline review evaluates foreign or consolidated material**

Both must:
- terminate explicitly
- either produce reviewable outputs or be abandoned

---

## From Exploration to Legitimacy

Once exploration converges:

- options may become **proposals**
- proposals may enter **baseline review**
- baseline review may create **sessions**
- sessions may create **legitimacy**

At no point does Charter assume intent.

Preparation is never mistaken for decision.
Memory is never mistaken for agreement.

---

## What Audit Must Preserve

Audit exists to reconstruct reality — not judgment.

It must always be possible to answer:

- What exploration occurred?
- When did it occur?
- Who participated?
- What artifacts were created?
- How did those artifacts change?
- Which options became proposals?
- Which proposals entered baseline review?
- Which sessions accepted them — or did not?

Audit must show **everything that happened**,
not just what “mattered in the end”.

---

## Why This Matters

Without breakouts:
- exploration leaks into sessions
- pressure to decide appears too early
- authority is misused to resolve ambiguity

Without synthesis:
- exploration becomes noise
- decisions lack context
- legitimacy is forced to compensate for confusion

Without audit:
- history collapses into outcomes
- rejected paths disappear
- trust erodes quietly

Charter preserves trust by:
- remembering **everything**
- legitimizing **almost nothing**

---

## Final Note

If this feels slow, it is.

If it feels uncomfortable, it should.

Exploration is allowed to be incomplete.  
Convergence is allowed to be messy.  
Legitimacy is allowed to be rare.

Audit does not rush reality.

It remembers it.
