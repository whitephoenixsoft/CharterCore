Deliberate is a structured, auditable workspace for parallel human thinking that produces zero or more candidate artifacts. Those artifacts are treated as foreign proposals and handed off as a single Baseline Review. The Baseline Review evaluates legitimacy and authority without assuming prior consent, and each accepted artifact produces its own session receipt (batched or hidden as needed). Breakouts, synthesis, and review all preserve audit clarity without ever fabricating consensus.
