# Usage Pattern: Decision Freeze and Reopening

This document describes how Charter handles change to accepted decisions.

Charter treats accepted resolutions as immutable.
Changes occur through supersession, not modification.

---

## Context

In many tools, decisions are represented as editable documents. This makes change easy, but legitimacy fragile.

Charter distinguishes between:

- Proposing a decision
- Accepting a decision
- Changing a decision

These are intentionally separate acts.

---

## The Pattern

1. A resolution is proposed and accepted
2. The resolution becomes immutable
3. New information or requirements emerge
4. A new session is started
5. A new resolution is accepted that supersedes the prior one
6. The original resolution remains preserved

At no point is the original decision edited.

---

## Why This Matters

Supersession preserves:

- Historical intent
- Authority context
- Temporal legitimacy


Editing erases:

- Who decided
- Under what assumptions
- At what time

Charter favors history over convenience.

---

## Common Misunderstandings

- “This is just a wording change”→ Still requires supersession
- “The intent didn’t change”→ Intent must remain inspectable
- “We need to move fast” → Speed is not legitimacy

---

## When Editing Is Acceptable

Editing may occur only before acceptance.

Once accepted, a resolution is frozen.


---

## Summary

Charter treats decisions as events, not documents.

Change is additive, not destructive.
