# User Guides
## Teaching the Charter Mentality

This directory contains **all human-facing guidance** for understanding Charter.

The guides are intentionally ordered.

Do not reorder them casually.

## Folder Structure

This structure is pedagogical, not cosmetic.

## 00 — The Problem

This section explains:
- *why* Charter exists
- what fails in existing systems
- how legitimacy, memory, and authority get confused
- why shortcuts are dangerous

These guides are:
- emotional
- conceptual
- intentionally uncomfortable

They are meant to reset expectations.

Readers should finish this section thinking:
> “Oh… that’s why this keeps breaking.”

If someone skips this section, **misuse later is expected**.

---

## 01 — Lifestyles

This section answers:
> “Given that problem, how does Charter fit *me*?”

These guides:
- personalize the Charter mentality
- show applicability without specialization
- demonstrate that rigor is universal, not corporate

They assume the reader already understands:
- why legitimacy matters
- why audit matters
- why friction is intentional

They do **not** re-teach first principles.

---

## What This Directory Is Not

This directory does NOT contain:
- CLI references
- command tutorials
- API documentation
- workflow recipes
- “getting started fast” guides

Those belong elsewhere.

This directory teaches **how to think**, not **what to type**.

---

## Contribution Rules (Strongly Enforced)

Any new guide must:
- respect the ordering philosophy
- reinforce Charter’s core invariants
- avoid selling, persuading, or optimizing for popularity
- assume an intelligent but skeptical reader

If a guide makes Charter feel easier by making it looser,
the guide must be rewritten or removed.

---

## Final Principle

Charter cannot be adopted by instruction alone.

It must be *understood* first.

These guides exist to make that understanding unavoidable.
