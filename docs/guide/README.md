# Charter Guide

This folder contains the **conceptual and thinking guides** for Charter.

These documents are not software documentation.
They are not API references.
They are not instructions for using a tool.

They exist to explain:
- why decision-making breaks down
- how legitimacy silently forms (or fails)
- why structure reduces conflict instead of creating it
- how decisions can be recorded without shame or blame

Many of these documents are useful **even without Charter**.

## How to Read These Guides

The guides are intentionally layered:

1. **Awareness documents**
   - Emotional recognition
   - “Oh… that’s what’s happening”
   - No jargon, no solutions yet

2. **Thinking models**
   - How to categorize decisions
   - How memory, authority, and outcomes differ
   - How structure reduces fatigue

3. **Organizational patterns**
   - Teams
   - Siloed work
   - Long-running systems

Later documents may reference Charter concepts — but none require the software.

If a document feels obvious:
That’s usually a sign it explains something you already learned the hard way.

## What This Folder Is Not

- Marketing material
- Process mandates
- A promise of features
- A substitute for lived experience

This is the shared language layer.
Everything else builds on it.
