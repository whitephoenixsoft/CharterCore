# Not All Decisions Are the Same  
*(And Treating Them Like They Are Is Why Everyone Is Tired)*

Most frustration around decision-making comes from a simple mistake:

We treat all decisions as if they belong to the same category.

They don’t.

When we mix different kinds of decisions together:

- meetings drag on  
- authority gets blurry  
- responsibility leaks  
- people feel stupid, defensive, or checked out  
- the loudest or longest-tenured person “wins” by default  

This isn’t a people problem.  
It’s a categorization problem.

Let’s fix that.

## The Core Idea (Simple, but Dangerous)

Before asking *“what should we decide?”*, you need to ask:

**“What kind of decision is this?”**

Different kinds of decisions require:

- different levels of agreement  
- different people involved  
- different time horizons  
- different emotional weight  

Treating a personal decision like a shared one creates resentment.  
Treating a shared decision like a personal one creates conflict.

If you don’t separate decision types, everything feels personal — even when it shouldn’t.

## The Four Common Decision Layers

These layers exist whether you name them or not.

Naming them doesn’t create structure.  
It just makes the existing chaos visible.

---

### 1. Personal Decisions  
**“This affects me.”**

These decisions:

- belong to one person  
- do not require consensus  
- may benefit from advice, but not permission  

**Examples**

- Self: “Should I change jobs?”  
- Family: “I need quiet time tonight.”  
- Work: “I’m choosing this implementation approach.”

**What goes wrong when this layer is violated**

- People ask for permission they don’t need  
- Others feel entitled to weigh in  
- Guilt replaces clarity  

If you need a committee to decide your lunch, something is off.

Personal decisions still have consequences — they just don’t require permission.

---

### 2. Shared Decisions  
**“This affects us directly.”**

These decisions:

- impact a defined group  
- require explicit agreement rules  
- fail if participation is vague  

**Examples**

- Friends: “Where are we going for dinner?”  
- Family: “Are we moving?”  
- Work: “Which architecture do we commit to?”

**What goes wrong here**

- “Everyone agrees” is assumed, not checked  
- Silence is mistaken for approval  
- Later resentment appears out of nowhere  

The fight isn’t about the decision.  
It’s about who thought they were included.

Shared decisions fail most often not because people disagree —  
but because no one agreed on *how agreement works*.

---

### 3. Structural Decisions  
**“This defines how decisions get made.”**

These decisions:

- set authority boundaries  
- define who must be involved  
- determine what blocks or allows action  

They don’t decide *what* happens.  
They decide *how decisions happen*.

**Examples**

- “Who needs to approve a production deploy?”  
- “What happens when we disagree?”  
- “Who owns this system boundary?”  
- “When does a decision need review?”

**What goes wrong when this layer is ignored**

- People argue substance when the real conflict is process  
- Seniority or confidence fills the vacuum  
- Teams burn energy re-litigating *how* to decide instead of *what* to decide  

When structure is missing, power becomes accidental.

---

### 4. Foundational Decisions  
**“This must remain true until we explicitly change it.”**

These decisions:

- are meant to outlive people  
- form the baseline for future choices  
- should not be casually revisited  

**Examples**

- “All production deploys require security approval.”  
- “This team owns customer data integrity.”  
- “We audit all access to financial records.”

**What goes wrong here**

- Decisions decay as people leave  
- New members unknowingly violate old rules  
- Teams re-decide the same things every year  

This isn’t stubbornness.  
It’s memory loss.

History is part of decision quality.

## Why This Matters

When all decisions are treated the same:

- personal choices feel political  
- shared decisions feel exhausting  
- structural gaps create blame  
- foundational rules quietly rot  

When decisions are separated by type:

- conversations get shorter  
- conflict becomes less personal  
- responsibility becomes clearer  
- teams stop feeling constantly tired

## How to Use This Model (Tomorrow)

Before debating content, ask:

- What kind of decision is this — personal, shared, structural, or foundational?
- Who is legitimately involved?
- Does this decision need to expire, or be remembered?

If people disagree about the *layer*, stop.

You’re not arguing about the decision.  
You’re arguing about what kind of decision it is.

Name that first.

Everything else gets easier.
