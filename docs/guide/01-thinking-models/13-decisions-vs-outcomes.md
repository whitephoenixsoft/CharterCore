# Decisions vs Outcomes  
*(Why Results Don’t Tell the Whole Story)*

One of the most damaging habits in teams is this assumption:

**If the outcome was bad, the decision must have been bad.**  
**If the outcome was good, the decision must have been good.**

This feels intuitive.  
It is also deeply wrong.

When decisions and outcomes are collapsed into one thing, learning stops and shame begins.

This document separates them on purpose.

## The Core Idea

A **decision** is an act taken with the information, constraints, and authority available *at the time*.

An **outcome** is what happens *after* reality responds.

They are related — but they are not the same.

If you don’t separate them:

- people hide uncertainty  
- risk-taking becomes unsafe  
- retrospectives turn into blame sessions  
- teams optimize for looking right instead of thinking well  

Separating decisions from outcomes isn’t philosophical.  
It’s practical.

## The Four Possible Combinations

Every decision falls into one of these categories.

Most teams only talk about two of them.

### 1. Good Decision → Good Outcome  
*(The obvious one)*

This is the case everyone wants.

- information was reasonable  
- reasoning was sound  
- authority was clear  
- outcome matched expectations  

**What usually happens**
- Celebration  
- Validation  
- Very little learning  

Ironically, this case teaches the least — because success hides fragility.

---

### 2. Good Decision → Bad Outcome  
*(The most important one)*

This is where mature teams are made.

- decision was reasonable given the facts  
- risks were acknowledged  
- process was followed  
- reality still disagreed  

**Examples**

- A well-researched product launch fails due to market timing  
- A safety-conscious deploy still hits an unforeseen edge case  
- A trading strategy works historically but fails under new conditions  

**What often goes wrong**

- People rewrite history  
- Decisions are judged with information that didn’t exist at the time  
- Individuals feel punished for things they couldn’t control  

This is where shame usually enters.

But this is also where the *best learning lives*.

---

### 3. Bad Decision → Good Outcome  
*(The dangerous one)*

This one feels good — and teaches the wrong lesson.

- shortcuts were taken  
- risks were ignored  
- reasoning was weak  
- luck intervened  

**What often happens**

- The decision is reinforced  
- The behavior is repeated  
- The system becomes fragile  

Teams mistake luck for skill.

This is how future failures are quietly planted.

---

### 4. Bad Decision → Bad Outcome  
*(The visible failure)*

This is the easiest case to talk about — and often the least interesting.

- missing information  
- unclear authority  
- rushed or emotional choices  
- predictable failure  

**What matters here**

Not punishment.  
Not blame.

But asking:

- Was the decision process clear?
- Was authority explicit?
- Was the risk understood?
- Was this avoidable *structurally*?

---

## Why This Separation Matters

When outcomes are used as proxies for decision quality:

- people avoid ownership  
- retrospectives become defensive  
- innovation slows down  
- analytics lie  

When decisions are evaluated *on their own terms*:

- people surface uncertainty earlier  
- risks are discussed openly  
- learning becomes continuous  
- improvement compounds  

This is how you create **learning loops without blame**.

---

## How This Shows Up in Practice

### Retrospectives
Instead of:
> “Why did this fail?”

Ask:
> “Given what we knew then, was this a reasonable decision?”

### Analytics
Instead of:
- ranking decisions by outcome only

Track:
- decision context  
- assumptions  
- confidence levels  
- time-to-feedback  

### Leadership & Trust
People trust systems where:
- they aren’t punished for bad luck  
- they *are* accountable for bad reasoning  

---

## The Shift This Requires

This model asks teams to move from:

- **Outcome-based judgment**  
to  
- **Decision-quality thinking**

From:
> “Who messed up?”

To:
> “What did reality teach us this time?”

That shift is uncomfortable at first.

Then it becomes freeing.

---

## Final Thought

You cannot guarantee good outcomes.

You *can* build systems that produce good decisions —  
and learn honestly when reality disagrees.

That’s not weakness.

That’s maturity.
