# Personal Decision Hygiene
(How to Decide Without Turning Everything Into a Big Deal)

When you’re the only decision-maker, things get weird fast.

Not because you lack skill —
but because there’s no external structure to tell you:

- what deserves a decision
- what deserves memory
- and what should be left alone

This document is about staying sane.

## The First Mistake: Making Everything a Decision

When people discover structured decision-making, they often overcorrect.

Suddenly:
- every thought feels important
- every doubt feels record-worthy
- every change feels like failure

That’s not discipline.
That’s anxiety with paperwork.

Good decision hygiene starts with **restraint**.

---

## Not Every Thought Deserves a Decision

Some things are:
- explorations
- drafts
- temporary preferences
- emotional check-ins

These should **not** be locked into decision memory.

Examples:
- “I’m thinking about switching tools”
- “This feels wrong today”
- “I might try this approach first”

These belong in:
- notes
- journals
- scratchpads
- experiments

If it’s still changing daily, don’t canonize it.

## Ask the One Question That Matters

Before making something a decision, ask:

> “Will future-me be confused or blocked if I don’t record this?”

If the answer is no —
you don’t need a decision yet.

If the answer is yes —
it probably deserves a home.

## Decisions Are Commitments, Not Feelings

A personal decision is not:
- how you feel today
- what you prefer right now
- what you’re unsure about

A personal decision *is*:
- a commitment you intend to follow
- something you’ll reference later
- a constraint you accept for a while

Example:
- ❌ “I feel burned out”
- ✅ “I will not take on new work this quarter”

One is a state.
The other is a decision.

## Editing Yourself Is Not Failure

Another common trap is treating change as weakness.

You make a decision.
Time passes.
You learn something.
You want to change it.

That’s not failure.
That’s the point.

But there’s a difference between:
- **replacing a decision**
- and **pretending the old one never existed**

Healthy hygiene means:
- you allow change
- without erasing history
- and without shaming your past self

Your past self didn’t know what you know now.
That’s not incompetence.
That’s time.

## Don’t Formalize to Avoid Discomfort

Some people use structure to avoid hard feelings.

They turn:
- uncertainty into “process”
- fear into “policy”
- doubt into “rules”

This creates rigid decisions that exist to protect emotions, not reality.

If you’re using formality to avoid thinking —
stop and step back.

Structure should support clarity, not replace it.

---

## Personal Authority Is Still Authority

When you decide alone, it’s tempting to downgrade the decision.

“It’s just me.”
“I can always change it.”
“It doesn’t really count.”

This is how people sabotage themselves.

If a decision matters:
- treat it with respect
- give it clear language
- make it easy to revisit intentionally

Future-you is still a stakeholder.

---

## A Simple Hygiene Checklist

Before recording a personal decision, check:

- Is this a commitment, not a feeling?
- Will it block or guide future actions?
- Am I okay being wrong later?
- Does this deserve memory, not just attention?

If yes — record it.
If no — let it breathe.

## The Goal Is Trust, Not Control

Good personal decision hygiene creates:
- self-trust
- calm
- momentum

Not rigidity.
Not perfection.
Not over-analysis.

You’re not trying to trap yourself.

You’re trying to help future-you understand
why things are the way they are.

That’s enough.
