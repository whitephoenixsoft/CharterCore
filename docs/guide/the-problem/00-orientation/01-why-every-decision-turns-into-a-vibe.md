# Why Every Decision Turns Into a Vibe  
*(and why that’s exhausting)*

Let’s start with a hard truth:

Most of the “decisions” in your life were never actually decided.  
They just… happened.  
And everyone quietly hoped no one would check later.

This document is about that.

Not process.  
Not rules.  
Not software.

Just the strange, exhausting reality of how humans “decide” things — at home, with friends, at work, and with ourselves — and why it keeps going wrong in the same ways.

If you’ve ever said any of the following, this is for you:

- “I thought we already agreed on this?”
- “Didn’t we decide that last time?”
- “Well… it was *kind of* decided.”
- “Let’s just go with it for now.”
- “Why is this a problem again?”

Welcome. You’re among friends.

## What a Decision Is *Supposed* to Be (but rarely is)

A real decision is boring.

It has:
- a moment when it happens
- people who were involved
- a result that can be pointed to later

That’s it.

But most of what we call decisions are actually:
- moods
- momentum
- avoidance
- politeness
- exhaustion
- vibes

Vibes feel efficient.  
Vibes are not durable.

## Example Level 1: Family (Where Vibes Are Born)

**Scenario:**  
“We’re not getting another pet.”

Everyone nods.  
No one writes it down.  
No one clarifies *when* or *why*.  
Everyone assumes it’s permanent.

Six months later:

> “I thought we said *after summer*.”
>
> “No, we said *not right now*.”
>
> “I didn’t agree, I just stopped arguing.”
>
> “Why are we fighting about this again?”

Congratulations.  
That wasn’t a decision.  
That was a **ceasefire**.

---

## Example Level 2: Friends (Where Memory Is Optional)

**Scenario:**  
Your group picks a restaurant.

Later:
- One person hates it
- One person swears they warned everyone
- One person doesn’t remember agreeing
- One person says “it’s fine” while clearly dying inside

Next time someone says:

> “Didn’t we decide we don’t like that place?”

What they mean is:

> “I would like the past to support my current feelings.”

The past does not work that way.

---

## Example Level 3: School / Early Work (The Soft Lie Era)

**Scenario:**  
A rule exists.

No one follows it.  
Everyone knows no one follows it.  
But it’s still quoted when convenient.

> “Technically, the policy says—”
>
> “Okay but nobody actually does that.”

This creates a magical state where:
- the rule is real
- the rule is fake
- breaking the rule is normal
- getting caught breaking it is *your fault*

This is not governance.  
This is **interpretive dance**.

---

## Example Level 4: Work (Where Decisions Go to Disappear)

**Scenario:**  
A meeting ends with:

> “Okay, let’s go with Option B.”

No one records:
- who agreed
- why
- under what constraints
- whether dissent existed

Three weeks later:

> “Why did we do this?”
>
> “Who approved this?”
>
> “Was this finalized or just a draft?”
>
> “Let’s revisit the decision.”

You are not revisiting a decision.  
You are excavating a **meeting-shaped hole in time**.

---

## Example Level 5: Self (The Most Chaotic Committee)

**Scenario:**  
“I’m going to wake up early.”

No date.  
No reason.  
No definition of “early.”

Next morning:
- Alarm ignored
- Guilt experienced
- Decision quietly forgotten

Later:

> “Why can’t I stick to decisions?”

Because that wasn’t a decision.  
That was a **thought with ambition**.

---

## The Common Pattern (Once You See It, You Can’t Unsee It)

Across all these examples, the same thing keeps happening:

- No clear moment of decision
- No shared understanding of who was involved
- No durable record
- No way to distinguish:
  - “we decided”
  - “we talked”
  - “we avoided conflict”
  - “we were tired”

So later, when reality pushes back, everyone argues about *history* instead of *substance*.

And arguing about history is the most exhausting argument of all.

---

## The Silent Tax You’re Paying

This way of operating has costs — even if you can’t name them yet:

- Re-litigating the same issues
- Emotional friction disguised as “miscommunication”
- People feeling unheard but unable to prove it
- Rules that exist only to shame people later
- Decisions that only feel real until pressure arrives

Worst of all?

People start believing the problem is *them*.

> “I’m bad at communicating.”  
> “I’m too indecisive.”  
> “I’m too rigid.”  
> “I should’ve spoken up.”

Sometimes that’s true.

Often, the system was just… nonexistent.

---

## A Small but Powerful Reframe

Here’s the shift that changes everything:

> **If you can’t clearly point to when a decision happened,  
> it didn’t happen.**

That’s not an accusation.  
It’s a relief.

It means:
- you’re not crazy
- your memory isn’t broken
- conflict isn’t a moral failure

It means the structure was missing — not the intelligence or goodwill.

---

## Why This Matters (Before Any Tools Exist)

Before processes.  
Before software.  
Before rules.

This is about recognizing:

- Decisions are *events*, not vibes
- Agreement is *explicit*, not implied
- History matters — but only if it exists

Once you see this, you’ll start noticing:
- how often decisions are faked
- how much emotional labor that creates
- how much energy is wasted pretending things are clear

And you might start wanting something different.

Not heavier.  
Not bureaucratic.  
Just… real.

## What Comes Next (Not Yet)

This document is not here to fix anything.

It’s here to say:

> “You’re not alone, and you’re not broken.”

The next step — when you’re ready — is learning how to:
- make decisions without shame
- preserve them without rigidity
- revisit them without gaslighting the past

We’ll get there.

For now, just notice the vibes.

They’re louder than you think.
