# What Must Never Change  
*(The Rules You Stop Debating)*

Most teams don’t fail because they disagree too much.

They fail because they keep debating things that were never supposed to be optional.

This document is about the rules that sit underneath all decisions — the ones that, if broken, mean you stop and fix the problem before moving on.

Not because someone says so.  
Because reality says so.

## The Core Idea

Some things are not preferences.  
Some things are not opinions.  
Some things are **always true**.

These are the rules that:

- **cannot be violated**
- **do not change based on mood or urgency**
- **override convenience**
- **force a stop if they break**

If everything is negotiable, nothing is stable.

---

## How to Recognize a “Must Never Change” Rule

Ask these questions:

- If this breaks, do we stop the work?
- Would violating this cause harm, loss, or legal exposure?
- Would “but we were in a hurry” ever be an acceptable excuse?
- Would we fire someone for ignoring this?

If the answer is yes — you’re not looking at a preference.

You’re looking at a non-negotiable.

## Common Places These Rules Live

You already know these. You just may not treat them consistently.

### Safety

Examples:
- “No one works on live equipment alone.”
- “We shut systems down if safety checks fail.”
- “Emergency procedures override deadlines.”

These rules don’t care how confident you feel.

If safety breaks, **everything else pauses**.

---

### Financial Boundaries

Examples:
- “We do not spend money we don’t have approval for.”
- “We do not manipulate financial reporting.”
- “Certain losses are unacceptable, regardless of upside.”

These aren’t risk preferences.  
They’re survival rules.

---

### Data Integrity

Examples:
- “We never silently change historical data.”
- “Customer data must not be exposed.”
- “Audits must be reproducible.”

If these fail, trust collapses — and no feature can fix that.

---

### Legal & Ethical Boundaries

Examples:
- “We follow the law, even when it slows us down.”
- “We do not misrepresent what the product does.”
- “We do not exploit users’ lack of understanding.”

These rules exist so people don’t have to make moral decisions under pressure.

## Why Teams Get This Wrong

Most teams don’t write these rules down.

So what happens?

- they get re-negotiated during emergencies  
- they get overridden by urgency or confidence  
- they get enforced inconsistently  
- new people learn them by getting burned  

The rule didn’t change.  
The memory of it did.

---

## What These Rules Are *Not*

They are not:

- goals  
- strategies  
- best practices  
- design preferences  
- “strong opinions”  

Those things evolve.

These rules **anchor**.

---

## How to Use These Rules Day-to-Day

When a decision is stuck, ask:

> “Is this violating something we said must never change?”

If yes — the decision is already made.

If no — debate freely.

This does two things at once:
- It protects what matters
- It frees everything else

---

## A Useful Reframe

Instead of saying:
> “That’s not allowed.”

Try:
> “If we do that, we break one of our always-true rules.”

It shifts the conversation from authority to reality.

---

## The Name (Optional)

Engineers have a word for these rules.

They call them **invariants**.

You don’t need the word to use the idea.

But once you notice them, you’ll start seeing them everywhere —  
in software, in teams, and in life.

And once they’re named, you can finally stop arguing about them.
