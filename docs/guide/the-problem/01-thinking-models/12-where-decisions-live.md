# Where Decisions Live  
*(Why Some Decisions Expire, Some Stack, and Some Must Be Replaced)*

Most teams don’t argue because they disagree.

They argue because they don’t know **which past decisions still count**.

This document is about decision memory — not storage, not tools, not process —  
but how humans keep track of what is still true.

---

## The Core Idea

Not all decisions are meant to live forever.

Some decisions:
- are temporary
- are context-bound
- must be replaced cleanly
- exist only to explain why something was done

If you store all decisions the same way, you get confusion instead of clarity.

---

## The Three Places Decisions Can Live

These categories exist whether you name them or not.

Naming them just prevents decay.

---

## 1. Ephemeral Decisions  
*(Useful now, irrelevant later)*

“These decisions solve *today’s* problem.”

Characteristics:
- expire naturally
- are context-specific
- should not be dragged into the future
- become noise if preserved too long

Examples:
- “Let’s meet at 3 instead of 2.”
- “Use this workaround until the fix ships.”
- “Pause feature work this week.”

What goes wrong when these are remembered forever:
- people argue with ghosts
- outdated context blocks progress
- “But last time we said…” derails everything

Ephemeral decisions should be:
- made quickly
- used fully
- forgotten on purpose

---

## 2. Superseded Decisions  
*(Replaced, not edited)*

“These decisions were correct — until something changed.”

Characteristics:
- represent deliberate choices
- must be replaced explicitly
- should never be silently edited
- form a chain of reasoning over time

Examples:
- “We chose architecture A.” → later replaced by architecture B
- “This policy applied last year.” → superseded by an updated one
- “This pricing model worked at our size.” → replaced at scale

What goes wrong when these are edited instead of replaced:
- history is rewritten
- lessons are lost
- blame creeps in
- nobody knows *why* the change happened

Superseded decisions should:
- remain visible
- be clearly marked as no longer active
- explain what replaced them

---

## 3. Permanent Decisions  
*(Still true, still binding)*

“These decisions define how we operate.”

Characteristics:
- do not expire
- constrain future choices
- require deliberate effort to change
- outlive projects and people

Examples:
- “We require security approval for production deploys.”
- “All financial changes are audited.”
- “This team owns this system.”

What goes wrong when these aren’t treated as permanent:
- rules get re-litigated
- enforcement becomes inconsistent
- new people don’t know what matters
- confidence erodes

Permanent decisions should:
- be easy to find
- rarely change
- demand explicit replacement if they do

---

## Why This Matters More Than Tools

When decision memory is unclear:
- meetings re-open closed topics
- turnover resets progress
- confidence becomes authority
- fatigue replaces trust

This isn’t a documentation problem.

It’s a **memory model problem**.

---

## A Simple Hygiene Rule

Before revisiting a decision, ask:

> “Was this meant to expire, be replaced, or still apply?”

If you can’t answer that, the argument makes sense.

---

## How This Sets Up Better Systems

Once teams separate:
- temporary decisions
- replaceable decisions
- permanent decisions

They naturally invent:
- specs (for permanent commitments)
- change proposals (for replacements)
- history tracking (for learning)

They don’t do this because process says so.

They do it because their brains stop hurting.

---

## The Quiet Insight

Good decision systems don’t prevent change.

They make **change explicit**, **traceable**, and **non-personal**.

That’s not bureaucracy.

That’s memory — working the way it was supposed to.
