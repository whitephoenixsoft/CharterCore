# The Loudest Person Isn’t the Problem — The Unspoken Rules Are

Every team has *that moment*.

The same person keeps deciding things.
They talk more.
They push harder.
They seem oddly confident about choices no one remembers agreeing to.

And eventually someone thinks — or says:

> “They’re dominating the team.”

This document is here to gently remove the blame from that sentence.

## Power Vacuums Are Real (And Someone Always Fills Them)

When a team doesn’t make its decision rules explicit, a vacuum forms.

That vacuum doesn’t stay empty.

Someone will fill it — not necessarily because they *want* power, but because:
- the work needs to move forward,
- silence feels irresponsible,
- or uncertainty is uncomfortable.

The loudest person isn’t usually power-hungry.
They’re often just the least willing to let things stall.

## Authority Defaults Emerge Naturally

In the absence of clear rules, authority defaults appear:

- Seniority (“They’ve been here longer”)
- Confidence (“They sound sure”)
- Proximity (“They talked to the customer”)
- Availability (“They’re always around”)
- Fatigue (“Fine, let’s just do it their way”)

None of these are evil.
None of these are wrong.

They’re *human shortcuts*.

The problem isn’t that people use them.
The problem is pretending they aren’t happening.

## Blame Is a Convenient Distraction

It’s easy to blame individuals:
- “They’re too opinionated.”
- “They bulldoze decisions.”
- “They don’t listen.”

Blame feels productive — but it hides the real issue.

When teams blame people, they avoid asking the harder question:

> “Why did our system require someone to dominate in the first place?”

Most people don’t want to carry invisible authority.
They just don’t want chaos.

## Turnover Makes This Worse (Not Better)

In teams with churn:
- new people don’t know past decisions,
- informal authority resets,
- and the loudest voice changes over time.

This makes power feel arbitrary.

Newcomers learn quickly:
- who “really decides,”
- which arguments matter,
- and when it’s safer to stay quiet.

None of this is written down.
Everyone learns it the hard way.

## The Relieving Truth

Here’s the part most people don’t hear enough:

**This isn’t a character problem.  
It’s a structural one.**

People fill gaps.
They don’t create them.

When authority is unspoken:
- power feels personal,
- conflict feels moral,
- and frustration turns inward.

When authority is named:
- disagreement becomes safer,
- quieter people re-enter the conversation,
- and the “loudest person” often relaxes.

## What This Document Is (and Isn’t)

This is **not** a call to silence confident people.  
This is **not** a critique of leadership.  
This is **not** a personality assessment.

It’s a release valve.

Once teams see that unspoken rules are doing the damage,
they can stop blaming people for playing by rules no one ever wrote.

Most ‘dominant personalities’ become much quieter once the rules stop requiring them to dominate.

And that’s where real change becomes possible.
