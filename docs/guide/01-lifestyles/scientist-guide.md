# Scientist Guide

*This guide describes how Charter can be used by teams like this — not how it must be used.*
## Decision Integrity Under Uncertainty

### Who This Is For

This guide is for scientists, researchers, and inventors who:
- revise hypotheses frequently
- manage many parallel experiments
- change their minds responsibly
- must defend decisions later

Charter does not judge correctness.
It preserves legitimacy.

## The Core Problem

Scientific work changes its mind — often.

But records usually track:
- results
- data
- conclusions

They rarely track:
- why paths were chosen
- why alternatives were rejected
- when uncertainty was acknowledged

Charter fills that gap.

## How Charter Fits Scientific Work

### Breakouts: Hypotheses and Exploration
Use breakouts to:
- list hypotheses
- explore experimental designs
- document unknowns
- capture failed paths

Nothing here is binding.
Failure is first-class.

---

### Synthesis: Structuring Uncertainty
Synthesis turns exploration into:
- viable experiment sets
- research directions
- open questions

You are not proving.
You are organizing thought.

---

### Sessions: Legitimate Commitments
Sessions are for:
- selecting experimental paths
- adopting protocols
- concluding studies

They preserve:
- authority context
- participant involvement
- moment-in-time reasoning

Changing your mind later is allowed — but traceable.

---

## Why This Matters

Charter allows you to say:
> “This was the best decision given the evidence at the time.”

That is the core of scientific integrity.

Not infallibility.
Not certainty.

---

## Mental Model

Think of Charter as:
- a decision layer on top of your lab notebook
- a hypothesis ledger
- an audit trail for intellectual honesty

It does not replace your tools.
It connects them.

---

## Final Thought

Science progresses by revision.

Charter makes revision *auditable instead of embarrassing*.
