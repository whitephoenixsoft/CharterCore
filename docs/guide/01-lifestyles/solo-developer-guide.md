# Solo Developer Guide
## Charter as Your Personal Decision Journal

### Who This Is For

This guide is for solo developers who:
- make many decisions alone
- revisit old code and wonder *why*
- keep notes, TODOs, and ideas scattered
- want rigor without bureaucracy

Charter does not replace your creativity.
It protects it from forgetting itself.

## The Core Problem

Solo work fails quietly.

There is no meeting to remember.
No minutes.
No witness.

Decisions are made:
- late at night
- under pressure
- with incomplete context

Weeks later, the reasoning is gone.

Charter exists to **externalize your thinking** so your future self can trust your past self.

## How Charter Fits Solo Work

Charter gives you three safe modes:

### 1. Exploration (Breakouts)
Use breakouts as:
- research logs
- brainstorming sessions
- “thinking out loud” moments

Nothing here is binding.
Nothing is judged.

You are allowed to be wrong.

---

### 2. Convergence (Synthesis)
Synthesis is where you say:
> “Here are the options that survived thinking.”

You can:
- discard bad ideas
- mark open questions
- defer uncertainty

You are not deciding yet.
You are organizing.

---

### 3. Legitimacy (Sessions)
A session is when you say:
> “I am committing to this.”

Even alone, this matters.

A session:
- freezes the moment
- records the authority (you)
- makes the decision defensible

This is how you stop re-litigating the same choice forever.

---

## Why This Works

Charter turns memory into structure.

Your audit log becomes:
- a personal memory palace
- a timeline of intent
- a defense against self-doubt

You no longer ask:
> “Was this a bad decision?”

You ask:
> “Given what I knew then, was this legitimate?”

That question is survivable.

## Mental Model

Think of Charter as:
- a lab notebook for software
- a decision diary with teeth
- a future-proof brain extension

If it feels slow sometimes, that means it’s working.

---

## Final Thought

You don’t need more discipline.
You need **durable thinking**.

Charter gives you that — without pretending you’re a team.
