# Long-Lived Institutions Guide
## RFCs, Orders, and Canonical Memory

### Who This Is For

This guide is for groups who expect their decisions to outlive them:
- standards bodies
- RFC authors
- long-lived committees
- religious or canonical orders

Charter is built for time.

## The Core Problem

Time erodes intent.

Participants leave.
Language shifts.
Context disappears.

Documents survive — but meaning drifts.

Charter preserves *how* decisions were made, not just *what* was decided.

---

## How Charter Fits Long-Term Governance

### Breakouts: Deliberation Without Pressure
Breakouts allow:
- theological discussion
- technical debate
- philosophical disagreement

Without forcing premature closure.

This protects legitimacy.

---

### Synthesis: Canon Formation
Synthesis is where:
- drafts mature
- alternatives are documented
- uncertainty is acknowledged

Nothing is implied.
Everything is recorded.

---

### Sessions: Canonical Acceptance
Sessions create:
- binding decisions
- authoritative resolutions
- immutable history

Authority is explicit.
Participation is frozen.
Interpretation is avoided.

---

## Audit as the System of Record

Charter’s audit trail ensures:
- future readers know who decided
- under what authority
- with which constraints
- and what alternatives existed

No myths.
No reconstruction.
No silent rewriting.

---

## Mental Model

Think of Charter as:
- a constitutional ledger
- a memory immune to reinterpretation
- a safeguard against accidental heresy (technical or doctrinal)

Friction is intentional.
It preserves trust.

---

## Final Thought

If your decisions must survive centuries,
they must survive scrutiny.

Charter is how you leave behind legitimacy — not just text.
