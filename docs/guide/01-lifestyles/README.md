# Lifestyle Guides
## How Different Humans Use Charter

This folder contains **audience-specific guides** that explain how Charter’s mental model applies to different ways of working and thinking.

These are **not feature guides**.
They are **not CLI tutorials**.
They are **not marketing content**.

They exist to answer a different question:

> “How does Charter fit *my* way of working without asking me to change who I am?”

## What These Guides Are

Each guide:
- assumes the reader already experiences real-world pain
- frames Charter as a *thinking model*, not a tool
- emphasizes legitimacy, memory, and audit over productivity hacks
- avoids prescribing workflows

They are meant to feel:
- reflective
- grounding
- slightly uncomfortable (in a good way)

---

## Current Guides

- **Solo Developer**  
  Charter as a personal decision journal and memory system.

- **Agile Team**  
  Charter as a stabilizer against process loss and decision drift.

- **Scientist / Researcher**  
  Charter as a way to preserve legitimacy while changing one’s mind.

- **Long-Lived Institutions (RFCs, Orders)**  
  Charter as canonical memory across decades or centuries.

Each guide uses the *same core model*:
- exploration
- convergence
- legitimacy

Only the framing changes.

---

## Design Constraint (Locked)

These guides must never:
- simplify Charter’s rigor
- promise convenience over defensibility
- reframe legitimacy as consensus or correctness
- imply that Charter “helps you decide faster”

If that happens, the guide is wrong.

---

## How to Extend This Folder

If adding a new lifestyle guide:
1. Identify a **distinct failure mode of memory or legitimacy**
2. Map Charter to that failure *without changing Charter*
3. Avoid jargon from that domain where possible
4. Teach the mentality before the mechanics

If a guide can be reduced to “features,” it does not belong here.

---

## Final Note

Charter is intentionally general.

Humans are not.

These guides exist to bridge that gap —  
without weakening the system on either side.
