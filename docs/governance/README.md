# Project Governance

This folder describes **how Charter is run**, not how it works.

It covers:
- contribution rules
- proposal processes
- review discipline
- release philosophy

These documents exist so that:
- contributors know what to expect
- decisions feel legitimate
- authority is explicit, not personal

## Relationship to Charter

This project attempts to:
- follow the same principles Charter enforces
- make decisions explicit
- preserve rationale over time

Before the software enforces this:
The documents do.

This folder is where that discipline lives.
