# Contributing to Charter Governance
Rules for Changing the Rules

This document applies to contributions that modify **governance artifacts**:
policies, invariants, decision processes, promotion rules, and meta-documents.

If you are changing code, CLI behavior, or documentation *about usage*,
this document may not apply.

If you are changing **how Charter decides, remembers, or legitimizes things** —
this document does.

## Why Governance Is Different

Governance documents are not explanations.
They are **constraints on future behavior**.

Changing them:

- affects contributors you haven’t met yet
- constrains decisions that haven’t happened
- alters how legitimacy is established
- shapes how conflict is resolved

Because of this, governance changes move slower by design.

Slowness here is not friction.
It is safety.

---

## Core Principle

**Governance changes must earn legitimacy before they earn adoption.**

Writing something down does not make it true.
Agreement does.

---

## What Counts as a Governance Change

This process applies to changes involving:

- invariants (what must never break)
- authority definitions
- scope boundaries
- decision promotion rules
- acceptance or rejection criteria
- auditability expectations
- how history is recorded or superseded
- meta-documents that explain how governance works

If a change affects **who decides**, **how decisions persist**, or **what cannot change** —
it is governance.

---

## What Does NOT Require Governance Promotion

These changes are allowed without escalation:

- spelling, grammar, or formatting fixes
- clarity improvements that do not change meaning
- reorganization without semantic change
- examples added for explanation only
- summaries that restate existing rules

If the intent, authority, or constraint does not change,
promotion is not required.

When in doubt, ask — but default to informality.

---

## How to Propose a Governance Change

Governance proposals should follow the same mental model as Charter itself.

A proposal must clearly state:

- what is changing
- what is not changing
- why the existing rule is insufficient
- what pressure or failure mode this change addresses
- which existing documents it affects or supersedes

Avoid solution-first framing.
Describe the problem before the rule.

---

## Authority and Review

Governance changes require:

- explicit discussion
- named reviewers with appropriate authority
- clear acceptance or rejection
- recorded reasoning

Silence is not consent.

If authority is unclear, the proposal pauses.
Ambiguity here is a signal — not a blocker to work, but a blocker to legitimacy.

---

## Rejection Is a Valid Outcome

A rejected governance proposal is not wasted effort.

Rejection:

- preserves institutional memory
- prevents repeated re-litigation
- clarifies boundaries
- builds trust through explicit reasoning

A clear “no” is healthier than an implied “maybe.”

---

## Conservatism Is the Point

Charter governance is intentionally resistant to change.

If a proposal feels frustratingly slow:
that may mean the system is working.

Governance exists to protect the future from the present —
including well-intentioned present contributors.

---

## Relationship to Charter the Engine

This process exists **before** Charter enforces it.

Over time:
- proposals map to candidates
- discussions map to deliberation
- acceptance maps to sessions
- documents map to decision memory

Until then, humans do the work explicitly.

---

## Final Note

Governance documents shape how power is exercised,
even when no one thinks they are using power.

If a rule cannot survive explanation, resistance, and time —
it does not belong here.

Move slowly.
Write carefully.
Assume future readers will not know your intent.

That is how legitimacy survives.
