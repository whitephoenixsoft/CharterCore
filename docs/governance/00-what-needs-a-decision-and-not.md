# What Needs a Decision (and What Doesn’t)

*A shared mental model for early work, iteration, and judgment.*

---

## Why This Document Exists

Not all work is a decision.

And not all decisions are worth remembering.

Early in a project — especially early development — most progress comes from:
- trying things
- changing your mind
- fixing obvious mistakes
- writing half-formed ideas
- deleting yesterday’s work without ceremony

This document exists to make one thing clear:

**You are allowed to work informally.**

You do not need permission to experiment.
You do not need approval to explore.
You do not need to promote every change into “official history.”

This is not a rulebook.
It is not a gate.
It is not a checklist.

It is a shared way to think about *when something becomes worth remembering*.

---

## The Core Idea (Keep This One Sentence)

> **When in doubt, leave it informal. Promotion is irreversible.**

That sentence exists to reduce fear — not to enforce correctness.

Judgment beats process here.

---

## Most Work Is Just Work (And That’s Healthy)

The majority of contributions should **never** become formal decisions.

That’s normal.
That’s expected.
That’s how things grow.

### Changes That Do *Not* Require Promotion

These are *safe to keep informal*:

- Typo fixes
- Formatting changes
- Renaming for clarity
- Refactoring with no semantic change
- Code cleanup
- Comment improvements
- Internal experiments
- Spikes or throwaway branches
- Exploratory documentation
- Early design sketches
- Notes that help you think
- Drafts you expect to rewrite

If this work disappeared tomorrow, and nothing meaningful would break —  
**it does not need to be remembered.**

And that’s okay.

## Changes That *May* Require Promotion (Use Judgment)

Some changes start informal — but *signal* that something more durable may be forming.

These don’t require immediate action.
They’re simply worth noticing.

### Signals to Pay Attention To

- The same question keeps coming back
- People disagree about “what we decided”
- Behavior changes, not just structure
- A document’s meaning changes, not just its wording
- A workaround becomes “the way we do things”
- Multiple areas or components are now coupled
- You find yourself explaining the same rationale repeatedly

None of these force promotion.

They are **nudges**, not alarms.

Often the right move is still:
> “Let’s keep going informally for now.”

---

## Changes That *Must* Be Remembered (Eventually)

Some decisions constrain the future.

These are the ones that tend to hurt when forgotten.

### Decisions Worth Preserving

- Changes to invariants (what must always be true)
- Shifts in authority (“who decides this now?”)
- Redefinitions of scope or responsibility
- Rules that block or enable other work
- Decisions that affect safety, security, or integrity
- Commitments that others will build on
- Anything that would be dangerous to silently reverse

These don’t have to be promoted *immediately* —
but they should not remain invisible forever.

---

## Non-Promotion Is Legitimate

This matters:

**Choosing not to promote something is itself a valid choice.**

You are allowed to:
- defer formalization
- keep things local
- avoid permanence
- decide later
- decide never

Promotion is not a reward.
It is not a badge.
It is not proof of seriousness.

It is simply a choice to remember something on purpose.

---

## This Is Training Wheels, Not Law

There is no “correct” cutoff.
There is no perfect timing.
There is no enforcement here.

This document exists to:
- lower anxiety
- protect iteration
- prevent premature formalism
- give permission to use judgment

If you ever feel unsure, default to informality.

History can always be added later.
Legitimacy cannot be undone once recorded.

---

## One Final Reassurance

Charter (and the processes around it) exist to keep us sane **over time**.

They are not here to:
- slow you down
- judge your work
- trap you in process
- make early work feel heavy

If the system ever makes you afraid to try things,
the system is wrong.

We can fix process.
We can’t recover lost curiosity.
