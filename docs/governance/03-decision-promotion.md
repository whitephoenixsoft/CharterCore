# Decision Promotion (From Issue to Memory)

This document explains how ideas become changes — or don’t.

It is not a workflow.
It is not a guarantee.
It is a set of simulations showing how legitimacy is earned, blocked, or deliberately rejected.

Most attempts do not result in promotion — and that is the healthy default.

If a promotion feels uncomfortable, that discomfort is usually the signal.

## Simulation 1 — An Idea That Should Stay an Idea

Context  
A contributor opens an issue suggesting a small ergonomic improvement.

Flow  
- Issue is opened
- Discussion happens
- Tradeoffs are explored
- No invariant is touched
- No long-term commitment is required

Outcome  
- Issue is closed
- No document is promoted
- No change is made

What This Teaches  
- Not all good ideas deserve permanence
- Closure is not failure
- Discussion can be the entire lifecycle

Legitimacy Preserved  
By *not* promoting something unnecessarily.

Stopping a promotion attempt early is often a success, not an abandonment.

## Simulation 2 — Clarification Without Change

Context  
A contributor notices ambiguity in an existing document.

Flow  
- Issue opened
- Confusion confirmed by others
- Proposal written as clarification
- No behavior changes

Outcome  
- Documentation updated
- No decision superseded or created
- No new authority created

What This Teaches  
- Promotion does not always mean change
- Clarifying meaning is a legitimate outcome
- History can be refined without rewriting it

---

## Simulation 3 — Proposal That Looks Small but Isn’t

Context  
A change is proposed that “just simplifies things.”

Flow  
- Issue opened
- Discussion reveals hidden coupling
- Impact touches invariants indirectly
- Review slows down

Outcome  
- Proposal is blocked
- Requires invariant-level discussion
- Issue remains open or is closed explicitly

What This Teaches  
- Size ≠ impact
- Slowness is a safety mechanism
- Escalation is not punishment

---

## Simulation 4 — Design Decision Promotion

Context  
A recurring argument keeps resurfacing across issues.

Flow  
- Someone documents the decision explicitly
- Proposal references prior debates
- Alternatives are recorded
- Decision is accepted

Outcome  
- A design decision document is created
- Future debates point to it
- The decision becomes referenceable history

What This Teaches  
- Repetition is a signal
- Decisions deserve a home
- Memory reduces friction

---

## Simulation 5 — Invariant Proposal (High Bar)

Context  
A contributor believes a rule must *never* be violated.

Flow  
- Proposal is written carefully
- Alternatives are exhaustively listed
- Simulations are required
- Review is conservative

Outcome  
- Either:
  - invariant accepted, or
  - proposal rejected with reasoning preserved

What This Teaches  
- Invariants are rare by design
- Rejection still creates knowledge
- Permanence requires restraint

---

## Simulation 6 — Rejection That Preserves Trust

Context  
A well-argued proposal is ultimately rejected.

Flow  
- Discussion is respectful
- Reasoning is explicit
- Decision is recorded
- No ambiguity remains

Outcome  
- Contributor understands why
- Future contributors don’t reopen it blindly
- Trust increases, not decreases

What This Teaches  
- Rejection is a valid outcome
- Silence is not
- Decisions protect people from re-litigation

---

## Simulation 7 — Promotion Without Consensus (Blocked)

Context  
Someone tries to push a change through momentum.

Flow  
- Issue escalated too quickly
- Review feels rushed
- Authority unclear

Outcome  
- Promotion blocked
- Change does not land
- Process pauses intentionally

What This Teaches  
- Momentum is not legitimacy
- Speed without authority is noise
- Blocking is protective, not hostile

---
## Where This Shows Up in Practice (Lightly)

In practice, these simulations often play out across:
- issues
- discussions
- pull requests
- design notes

The medium doesn’t matter.
The *promotion decision* does.

---
## The Rule of Promotion

If a change:
- keeps coming back
- affects more people over time
- constrains future choices
- or carries emotional weight

It does not belong in an issue thread.

It belongs in decision memory.

---

## Final Note

Promotion is not about hierarchy.
It is about *deserving to persist*.

If something cannot survive explanation, review, and resistance —
it should not survive time.
