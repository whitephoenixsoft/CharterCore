# Start Here — Welcome — You Didn’t Break Anything

*A gentle onboarding guide for humans contributing to Charter*

First things first:

You are not expected to understand the whole system.
You are not expected to finish anything.
You are not expected to make “important” changes.

If you made something a little clearer, a little safer, or a little less confusing —
that already counts.

This guide exists to answer one simple question:

**“I changed something. Now what?”**

---

## The Big Idea (Relax, This Is Not a Test)

Charter is built around one principle:

> Not everything needs to become permanent.

Most good work starts informal.
Some work stays informal forever.
That’s not failure — that’s *healthy iteration*.

This project is designed so you can:
- start something
- improve something
- walk away
- come back later (or not)

No guilt. No ownership traps.

If you’re here to explore or learn, you’re already a valid contributor.

## What “Promotion” Means (In Plain English)

**Promotion** is when a change moves from:
> “This seems right”  
to  
> “We want to remember this.”

That’s it.

Promotion does **not** mean:
- approval
- authority
- correctness
- extra responsibility
- more work for you

Promotion **does** mean:
- the change is now part of the project’s memory
- future changes will take it into account
- it won’t be silently forgotten or overwritten

### The Most Important Rule

> **When in doubt, leave it informal. Promotion is irreversible.**

You can always promote later.
You cannot un-remember something once it’s canon.

---

## Most Changes Do *Not* Need Promotion

This is normal. Expected, even.

Examples of changes that usually stay informal:
- fixing typos or wording
- refactoring without changing meaning
- exploratory docs
- early sketches
- experiments
- “I think this might be clearer” edits

These are valuable.
They keep the project alive.
They do not need ceremony.

---

## Changes That *Might* Want Promotion (Eventually)

Sometimes a change keeps coming back.

That’s your signal.

Examples:
- behavior subtly changes
- meaning shifts, not just wording
- the same debate repeats
- multiple areas are affected
- people start asking “wait, what did we decide?”

That doesn’t mean “promote now.”
It means:
> “This might deserve a home someday.”

You can flag it.
You can ask.
You can leave a note.

You don’t have to finish the thought.

---

## Changes That *Must* Be Remembered

These are rarer — and heavier.

Examples:
- invariants (“this must always be true”)
- authority changes (“who decides this”)
- scope changes (“where this applies”)
- decisions that constrain future options

If you touch one of these:
- slow down
- ask for help
- don’t guess

This isn’t about gatekeeping.
It’s about protecting the project *and* you.

---

## You Are Allowed to Walk Away

Seriously.

Open source — especially Charter — is not:
- a contract
- a promise
- a moral obligation

If you:
- start an issue
- open a doc
- sketch an idea
- improve one paragraph

…and then disappear —

That is still a win.

Someone else can continue.
Or not.
That’s okay too.

---

## If You’re Unsure What You Just Touched

That’s normal.
Everyone is unsure at first.
Even the maintainer was.

If you’re confused:
- ask which *area* this lives in
- ask which *layer* it affects
- or just say “I don’t know if this matters long-term”

That sentence alone is enough to start the right conversation.

---

## This Is a Map, Not a Maze

Nothing here is a trap.
Nothing here is a trick.
Nothing here is designed to catch mistakes.

The structure exists to:
- reduce confusion
- reduce re-litigation
- reduce burnout
- keep decisions honest over time

You don’t need to master it.
You just need to know it’s here.

---

## Final Reassurance

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

> You are allowed to contribute without committing.  
> You are allowed to help without deciding.  
> You are allowed to leave things unfinished.

That’s not a flaw in the system.

That’s the system working.
