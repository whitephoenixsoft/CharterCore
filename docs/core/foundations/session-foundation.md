# Charter Core — Session Foundation

Version: 0.2  
Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Layer: Conceptual / Human Interface (Engine-adjacent)  
Applies to: Charter Core semantics, CLI behavior, and guidance layers  
Does NOT define: engine invariants, authority mechanics, or UX guarantees

## Purpose

Sessions are the sole mechanism by which **legitimacy is created** in Charter.

They exist to transform **candidate resolutions** into **explicit, auditable commitments**, while preserving human agency, clarity, and psychological safety.

This document defines:

- What a session *is* conceptually
- How sessions relate to resolutions and legitimacy
- Why annotations and rationale are first-class
- How sessions support mature, confident decision-making over time

Sessions do not optimize outcomes.  
They make ownership explicit.

---

## Mental Model — Sessions as Bounded Commitment Spaces

A session is a **bounded workspace for legitimacy**, where humans choose to commit under known rules.

Within a session:

- Authority is explicit
- Scope is explicit
- Participants are explicit
- Permanence is acknowledged
- History is recorded without interpretation

Sessions do **not**:

- Decide automatically
- Infer consensus
- Interpret intent
- Reduce ambiguity silently

A session exists so that a human can say:

> “I am committing to this — under these rules — at this time.”

---

## Core Properties of Sessions

### 1. Legitimacy Through Explicit Ownership

Only resolutions **accepted within a session** are legitimate.

Sessions ensure that:

- Authority at acceptance is recorded
- Scope at acceptance is recorded
- Participants at acceptance are recorded
- Stances are recorded
- Context is preserved

Legitimacy is never inferred.
It is always **owned**.

---

### 2. Sessions Operate on Candidates

Sessions evaluate **candidate resolutions**.

Candidates:

- May originate anywhere (drafting, deliberate, breakout, baseline review)
- Have no authority or meaning until accepted
- Carry annotations and rationale that may later become permanent

Acceptance is the *only* transition from candidate → resolution.

---

### 3. Authority and Scope Are Preconditions

Every session operates under an active:

- **Authority** — how agreement is evaluated
- **Scope** — what domain is affected

Sessions may exist when governance is under review, but:

- No legitimacy may be created while required governance is unresolved
- Such sessions are **BLOCKED**, not invalid

Sessions never guess governance.
They record it.

---

### 4. Annotations and Rationale Are First-Class

Annotations and rationale are **part of legitimacy**, not decoration.

They exist to explain:

- Why a resolution exists
- Why it was accepted
- What context mattered at the time
- Why permanence or irreversibility was chosen

Because annotations shape future interpretation:

- They are immutable once acceptance occurs
- Adding missing context later requires a new resolution

Annotations reduce ambiguity.
They do not reinterpret history.

---

### 5. Irreversibility Is Acknowledged, Not Punitive

Resolutions may be marked as:

- Reversible
- Conditionally reversible
- Irreversible

These markers:

- Do not judge correctness
- Do not prohibit reflection
- Exist to prevent silent revision

Rationale should explain permanence explicitly.

Sessions normalize irreversible decisions as:

- Auditable
- Thoughtful
- Non-shaming
- Part of learning over time

---

## Session Lifecycle (Conceptual)

A session may pass through these states:

- **ACTIVE** — candidates and context may be developed
- **PAUSED** — activity intentionally halted
- **BLOCKED** — legitimacy cannot proceed due to unresolved dependency
- **CLOSED** — history sealed; no further action allowed

All state transitions are explicit and auditable.

Closure preserves clarity.
Open-ended sessions are discouraged.

---

## Relationship to Other Charter Constructs

- **Resolutions**  
  Sessions are the only path to legitimacy.

- **Baseline Review**  
  Baselines are review workspaces. Sessions are commitment mechanisms.  
  UNDER_REVIEW in baseline ≠ UNDER_REVIEW in canonical governance.

- **Deliberate & Breakouts**  
  These explore ideas. Sessions commit to them.

- **Audit**  
  Every session contributes to an append-only audit trail.

Sessions sit at the boundary between *thinking* and *deciding*.

---

## Psychological Safety and Human Growth

Sessions are designed to support human development, not pressure it.

They encourage:

- **Clarity** — decisions are explicit
- **Confidence** — permanence is acknowledged, not hidden
- **Learning** — history is preserved without shame
- **Courage** — mistakes are survivable and traceable

Over time, disciplined use of sessions cultivates:

- Mature decision-making
- Reduced fear of commitment
- Increased trust in one’s own judgment

Sessions do not moralize.
They illuminate.

---

## End States

Every session ends explicitly as one of:

- **Accepted** — one or more resolutions become legitimate
- **Abandoned** — no legitimacy created; history preserved

There is no implicit success or failure.
Only recorded outcomes.

---

## Conceptual Invariants (Non-Mechanical)

- Legitimacy requires explicit acceptance
- Authority and Scope must be known at acceptance
- Annotations that explain legitimacy are immutable
- History must be reconstructible end-to-end
- Sessions never infer intent or consensus

---

## Summary

Sessions are the bridge between **human intent** and **canonical legitimacy**.

They:

- Make ownership explicit
- Preserve context
- Protect against silent reinterpretation
- Enable reflection without shame
- Support growth over time

A session is not just where a decision happens.

It is where a human chooses to stand behind it.
