# Charter Core — Session Foundation
Version: 0.1  
Status: FOUNDATIONAL  
Scope: Charter CLI / Engine Interaction Layer  

---

## Purpose

Sessions are the **primary mechanism by which legitimacy is realized** in Charter. They transform candidate resolutions into **owned, auditable commitments**, while preserving human agency and psychological safety.

The purpose of this foundation document is to explain:

- What sessions are conceptually
- How they relate to resolutions and legitimacy
- How annotations and rationale support human understanding
- How they help cultivate mature, confident decision-making

---

## Mental Model: Sessions as Safe Spaces

A session is a **bounded workspace for creating legitimacy**, where:

- Humans explicitly commit to resolutions
- Authority and scope are respected
- Decisions are auditable and traceable
- The psychology of permanence is supported

Sessions do **not**:

- Make decisions automatically
- Infer consensus
- Replace human judgment

Sessions **exist to help humans own their actions**.

---

## Key Concepts

### 1. Legitimacy through Ownership

- Only resolutions accepted in sessions become **legitimate**.
- Sessions ensure that authority, scope, and participants are explicitly recorded.
- Legitimacy is traceable, not inferred.

### 2. Candidate Resolutions

- Sessions operate on **candidate resolutions** produced by any workflow (solo drafting, deliberate, breakout, baseline review).
- Candidates are **non-authoritative** until accepted in a session.

### 3. Authority & Scope

- Every session evaluates legitimacy **within the context of authority and scope**.
- Authority defines who may commit a resolution.
- Scope defines the domain affected by the resolution.
- Both must be explicit before legitimacy is granted.

### 4. Annotation & Rationale Fields

- Each session and resolution may include **annotations** and **rationale** explaining context, intent, and reasoning.
- Example use cases:
  - Explaining why a resolution is irreversible
  - Documenting thought processes during a complex deliberation
  - Capturing considerations that may affect future decisions

Annotations **reduce ambiguity** and support human understanding, especially for **long-lived or permanent commitments**.

### 5. Irreversibility

- Resolutions may be marked **reversible**, **conditionally reversible**, or **irreversible**.
- The rationale field should **explain the permanence** of the decision.
- Sessions normalize permanent decisions:
  - Traceable, auditable
  - Not a source of shame
  - Encourages learning and confidence in future decisions

### 6. Relationship to Other Constructs

- **Baseline Review**: sessions may be created from accepted resolutions after review.
- **Deliberate & Breakouts**: sessions are the endpoint for ideas explored in these spaces.
- **Audit**: all session activity contributes to the audit trail, supporting transparency.
- **Resolution Foundation**: sessions are the mechanism by which resolutions gain legitimacy.

## Psychological Guidance

Charter sessions support **human growth alongside software**:

- By making ownership explicit, sessions encourage **mature clarity**.
- Clarity reduces **shame**, enabling honest reflection and improvement.
- Confidence grows, providing the **courage to make mistakes safely**.
- Over time, using sessions fosters a culture of deliberate, responsible decision-making.

> Side note: personally, the goal is to **grow with the software** and help others mature in their decision-making. Using sessions deliberately can instill clarity, confidence, and courage in all users.

---

## End States

Every session concludes in one of two ways:

- **Accepted**: candidate resolutions become legitimate, annotated, and auditable.
- **Abandoned**: candidate resolutions remain non-legitimate but are preserved for historical context.

Open-ended sessions are discouraged; closure preserves clarity and audit integrity.

---

## Invariants (Conceptual)

- Only one authoritative acceptance occurs per resolution per session.
- Authority and scope must be defined before legitimacy is granted.
- Annotations and rationale must accompany irreversible or conditionally reversible resolutions.
- History must be reconstructible end-to-end.

---

## Summary

Sessions are **the psychological and procedural bridge** between human intent and canonical legitimacy.  

They:

- Give resolutions meaning
- Protect participants from implicit assumptions
- Preserve clarity and traceability
- Foster mature, confident decision-making

Sessions are **not just a software mechanism**, they are a tool for humans to **own their actions, reflect safely, and grow in judgment over time**.
