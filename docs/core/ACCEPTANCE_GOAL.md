# Charter Core — Acceptance Goal

Charter Core is complete when:

- A user can define an Area
- Authority and Scope are established via sessions
- Decisions can be proposed as candidates
- Decisions can be accepted as resolutions
- Authority and Scope changes do not rewrite history
- Past decisions remain interpretable and legitimate
- The system operates fully without AI or UI

Anything beyond this belongs in higher layers.
