# Charter Core — Mental Model

Charter Core treats decisions the way source control treats code:
immutable, explicit, and historically correct.

An Area is like a repository.
Authority and Scope are like protected configuration pointers.
Sessions are commits.
Candidates are diffs.
Resolutions are accepted changes.

Nothing is overwritten.
Nothing is inferred.
Nothing happens without an explicit action.

Charter Core answers one question reliably:

> "Was this decision legitimate at the time it was made?"
