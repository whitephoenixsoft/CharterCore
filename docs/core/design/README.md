# Core Design Decisions

This folder records **design decisions that persist**, but are not specifications.

These decisions:
- shape future work
- constrain implementation choices
- explain *why* the system looks the way it does

They are not enforced mechanically —
they are enforced by memory.

## Examples of Design Decisions

- Why Charter is deterministic
- Why authority is explicit
- Why silence is never treated as consent
- Why legitimacy is separate from outcomes

## When to Add a Design Decision

If a discussion:
- keeps resurfacing
- blocks progress repeatedly
- affects multiple contributors
- feels “obvious” only after debate

It probably deserves a document here.

## What This Folder Prevents

- Re-litigating old debates
- Accidental erosion of principles
- Knowledge loss through turnover

If a decision keeps coming back:
It deserves a home.
