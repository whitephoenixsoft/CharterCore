# Charter Core

Charter Core is a deterministic governance engine for recording, evolving, and auditing agreed decisions within explicit authority and scope.

Charter Core is designed to preserve institutional integrity by making decisions explicit, immutable, and reviewable over time.

It does not provide chat, AI facilitation, or user experience features.
Those are intentionally handled by separate layers.

## What Charter Core Does

- Defines governance Areas
- Records Authority and Scope as first-class decisions
- Facilitates structured decision sessions
- Captures candidates and accepted resolutions
- Preserves immutable decision history
- Supports review, supersession, and retirement of decisions

## What Charter Core Does NOT Do

- Monitor conversations
- Infer decisions
- Provide user interfaces
- Require AI
- Enforce workflows beyond decision legitimacy

Charter Core is intentionally boring, explicit, and trustworthy.
