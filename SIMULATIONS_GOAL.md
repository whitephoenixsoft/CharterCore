Simulation 8 — Manual Governance, AI Disabled (Baseline)

Context

AI orchestration is completely disabled

One or more humans

Charter is used purely as a governance engine


Flow

1. User creates an Area

Defines scope in plain language

Defines authority (self or group)

Selects a resolution template



2. User starts a session

Session is ACTIVE

No AI facilitation is present



3. Users manually add candidates

Resolution text is written directly

Supporting rationale may be pasted from external tools



4. Discussion happens externally or inline

Slack, meetings, documents, or notes

Charter does not orchestrate conversation



5. User explicitly accepts a candidate

Authority is checked

Scope is checked



6. Resolution is created

Immutable

Stored in decision memory




Validated Invariants

Explicit acceptance

Immutability

Decision memory

Scale independence

AI optionality


Why It Matters Charter must provide value as a ledger of legitimacy, not as a thinking engine.

Simulation 9 — Slack as the Thinking Space, Charter as the Record

Context

Team collaborates primarily in Slack

Charter is used for long-term memory and legitimacy


Flow

1. Team discusses options in a Slack thread


2. One user starts a Charter session


3. User manually summarizes key options into candidates


4. Team confirms agreement in Slack


5. Authorized user accepts a resolution in Charter


6. Resolution links back to the Slack thread



Validated Invariants

Separation of conversation from commitment

No implicit decisions

Integrations as context only


Why It Matters Charter must fit naturally into existing collaboration habits.

Simulation 10 — Single-User Reasoning Without AI

Context

Solo founder or individual contributor

Uses Charter as a decision journal


Flow

1. User creates Area with self-authority


2. User starts a session


3. User writes multiple candidate options manually


4. User reflects and revises text


5. User explicitly accepts one option


6. Months later, user supersedes it



Validated Invariants

Explicit acceptance even without oversight

Supersession preserves evolution

Decision memory over time


Why It Matters Governance is still meaningful without multiple participants.

Simulation 11 — UI-Imposed Turns (Engine-Agnostic)

Context

A frontend chooses to enforce turn-taking

Engine itself does not know about “rounds”


Flow

1. UI restricts who can add candidates at a time


2. Engine receives proposals normally


3. Acceptance still happens explicitly


4. Engine enforces scope and authority



Validated Invariants

Engine neutrality

UI freedom

No coupling of behavior to core semantics


Why It Matters Different cultures need different interaction styles.


---

Summary (Goal)

Even without AI, without rounds, and without enforced UX patterns:

> Charter still preserves legitimacy, intent, and institutional memory.



If these simulations fail, Charter has lost its core value.
